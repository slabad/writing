Intro: 
Clickbait
```ad-note
title: Just one thing??
collapse:

Here's how the online claim went, “If you just do this one thing, you can lose 50 pounds in 50 days.” Or wait... maybe it was, “If you just do this one thing, you'll have that 'beach body' in weeks, not months.” I can't remember the exact details, and... I don't know what that “one thing” was or is (probably because I didn't click on the ad). But whatever the promise, what struck me was the marketing strategy involved: 'you can't lose weight (or fill in the blank) because you've made everything too complex and now you're discouraged. But it's actually... all very simple.'

There's something appealing about that claim, isn't there. If we could just simplify things, life would be easier. Well, what if I were to make a similar claim: “If you just do this one thing, you can experience life as it was meant to be lived.” Wow. That's even better than losing 50 pounds, right? But isn't that just another marketing ploy? 'Clickbait'? Well...

Let's look together at the Gospel of Mark this morning, chapter 12, and listen to Jesus as he talks about that “one thing” above every other “one thing”.

Unintended consequences - social media
- talk about the current state of social media
- how it is engineered to drive division


at the end, bring love your neighbor back around




Loving God is Easy?
- no other gods
- obedience
- surrender
	- Not so easy with a sin nature because our bent is to exalt ourselves and to be like God
		- That is what Adam and Eve did...where they went
	- To love God is to take up our cross daily
		- To follow him regardless of the circumstances that cross our paths
		- To love God is to continue to embrace him to the point where our friends and family start asking questions.
- 

Possible Outline:
1. [[202201081294 Love God]]
2. [[202201081252 Love Others]]






Loving your neighbor
- The opposite of what comes natural
	- Natural is
		- judge your neighbor, covet your neighbor's stuff
		- 
- listen to people without responding in the moment
	- seek to understand rather than educate
- Understand who the enemy is.- Jesus' critiques in the NT were regarding the religious leaders
- How does the story of the good samaritan relate to today
	- Samaritans were outsiders 
		- Immigrants/half breeds
		- people who deviated from acceptable cultural norms
		- Regarded as potentially destructive to the status quo
			- considered dangerous to the jewish way of life - 
				- Our kids could be influenced by them!
		- Why were they hated? See [[Why The Jews Hated The Samaritans]]
			- Cultural reasons
				- different religious practices
					- Kind of like Muslims
					- Worshiped Jehovah, but it was mixed up
	- Levite/Priest
		- Insiders
		- Upholders of culture
		- representative of the status quo


Social media 
- Hackers Podcast
	- Social media has been hacked...from both sides to sow division and discord
	- Not just in the United states, but around the world. It is being used to manipulate large populations of people
		- Think Nazi Germany and propaganda
		- Story of Orson Wells "War of the Worlds"


Who is my neighbor?
- Who would Jesus have used in place of the Samaritan today?
	- the muslim family across the street?
	* the married lesbian couple two houses down?
	* the illegal immigrant working three jobs?
	* the person/group on social media who makes my blood boil?

How do you react when encountering someone different than you?
* Levite/Preist
	* Avoid
	* Ignore
	* These were good people
		* They found good reasons to walk on by
* Samaritan
- all kinds of options

All kinds of wrong with this story
- the samaritan is the good guy - the example of how to live
- The bad guys were the religious leaders of the day
	- These were the "role models" who showed others how to live


Jamey Dickens - Price Check
https://northpoint.org/messages/love-thy-neighbor/price-check
Two things - 
- How we think: Value
	- You know how valuable something is by what someone is willing to pay
		- What is our value, what is our neighbor's value
		- This is the thing that can change our perspective
		- 1 Peter 1:18
			- You were not redeemed with silver and gold
			- We were bought back with the blood of Christ
				- This is our worth to God
			- This tells us our value
		- Not only true of us but also of our neighbor
			- God tells us how much our neighbor is worth
		- We have immense value
			- How do we treat something of immense value?
				- With great care
	-  We should put a price tag on others in the same way Jesus does
		- The price he put on our lives, was his own.
		- We ought to value people the same way Jesus did
		- We ought to look at others and put a price on them
			- the blood of Jesus...the sacrifice on Jesus
			- The value of the lives around us is higher than the position we hold.
	- Everyone is someone
- What we do:
	- We can "think" correctly all we want, but without 
	- The good Samaritan is Intense action
	- Three things
		- A need to Notice
			- Do we see needs around us?
			- Loving your neighbor means noticing their need
			- The hero of the story was hugely controversial
				- Samaritan
					- Centuries of national conflict, religious and racial tension
		- Barrier to breakthrough
			- Comfort, social norms, patriotism, religion, status, racial prejudice
			- The barriers between these two were immense
			- Three men walked by, only one took notice and pitied
			- What barriers have stopped you from loving your neighbor
			- What stops us from loving our neighbor
				- baggage not our bank account
					- discomfort, messiness, inconveniences, differences
					- Barriers that have been built and bolstered by the media
		- Price to pay
			- time, money
			- we are called to pay the price for our neighbor's healing
	- "Go and do likewise"
		- 4 powerful words

A good samaritan is not something to describe a hero...it is a term to describe a Christian...a Jesus follower!

Loving our neighbor means we don't just walk by...


We are called to love people regardless of...
- religion, lifestyle, beliefs, race, nationality

We Judge...
- someone's response
- lack of response
- action 
- lack of action
- Someone's beliefs
	- We are quick to cry heretic
	- We value right thought over people
