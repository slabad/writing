Alternative intro:
What is your life worth?


Loving God is Easy?
- no other gods
- obedience
- surrender
	- Not so easy with a sin nature because our bent is to exalt ourselves and to be like God
		- That is what Adam and Eve did...where they went
	- To love God is to take up our cross daily
		- To follow him regardless of the circumstances that cross our paths
		- To love God is to continue to embrace him to the point where our friends and family start asking questions.
- 




Loving your neighbor
- The opposite of what comes natural
	- Natural is
		- judge your neighbor, covet your neighbor's stuff
- listen to people without responding in the moment
	- seek to understand rather than educate
- Understand who the enemy is.- Jesus' critiques in the NT were regarding the religious leaders
- How does the story of the good samaritan relate to today
	- [[202201231470 Samaritans were outsiders]]

Social media 
- Hackers Podcast
	- Social media has been hacked...from both sides to sow division and discord
	- Not just in the United states, but around the world. It is being used to manipulate large populations of people
		- Think Nazi Germany and propaganda
		- Story of Orson Wells "War of the Worlds"


Who is my neighbor?
- Who would Jesus have used in place of the Samaritan today?
	- the muslim family across the street?
	* the married lesbian couple two houses down?
	* the illegal immigrant working three jobs?
	* the person/group on social media who makes my blood boil?

How do you react when encountering someone different than you?
* Levite/Preist
	* Avoid
	* Ignore
	* These were good people
		* They found good reasons to walk on by
* Samaritan
- all kinds of options

All kinds of wrong with this story
- the samaritan is the good guy - the example of how to live
- The bad guys were the religious leaders of the day
	- These were the "role models" who showed others how to live


[[Jamey Dickens - Price Check]]

A good samaritan is not something to describe a hero...it is a term to describe a Christian...a Jesus follower!

Loving our neighbor means we don't just walk by...


We are called to love people regardless of...
- religion, lifestyle, beliefs, race, nationality

We Judge...
- someone's response
- lack of response
- action 
- lack of action
- Someone's beliefs
	- We are quick to cry heretic
	- We value right thought over people
