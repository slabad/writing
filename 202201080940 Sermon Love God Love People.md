Intro: 
Clickbait
```ad-note
title: Just one thing??
collapse:

Here's how the online claim went, “If you just do this one thing, you can lose 50 pounds in 50 days.” Or wait... maybe it was, “If you just do this one thing, you'll have that 'beach body' in weeks, not months.” I can't remember the exact details, and... I don't know what that “one thing” was or is (probably because I didn't click on the ad). But whatever the promise, what struck me was the marketing strategy involved: 'you can't lose weight (or fill in the blank) because you've made everything too complex and now you're discouraged. But it's actually... all very simple.'

There's something appealing about that claim, isn't there. If we could just simplify things, life would be easier. Well, what if I were to make a similar claim: “If you just do this one thing, you can experience life as it was meant to be lived.” Wow. That's even better than losing 50 pounds, right? But isn't that just another marketing ploy? 'Clickbait'? Well...

Let's look together at the Gospel of Mark this morning, chapter 12, and listen to Jesus as he talks about that “one thing” above every other “one thing”.

Loving God is Easy?
- no other gods
- obedience
- surrender
	- Not so easy with a sin nature because our bent is to exalt ourselves and to be like God
		- That is what Adam and Eve did...where they went
	- To love God is to take up our cross daily
		- To follow him regardless of the circumstances that cross our paths
		- To love God is to continue to embrace him to the point where our friends and family start asking questions.

Loving your neighbor
