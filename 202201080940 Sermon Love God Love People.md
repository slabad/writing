Intro: 
Clickbait??
```ad-note
title: Just one thing??
collapse:

Here's how the online claim went, “If you just do this one thing, you can lose 50 pounds in 50 days.” Or wait... maybe it was, “If you just do this one thing, you'll have that 'beach body' in weeks, not months.” I can't remember the exact details, and... I don't know what that “one thing” was or is (probably because I didn't click on the ad). But whatever the promise, what struck me was the marketing strategy involved: 'you can't lose weight (or fill in the blank) because you've made everything too complex and now you're discouraged. But it's actually... all very simple.'

There's something appealing about that claim, isn't there. If we could just simplify things, life would be easier. Well, what if I were to make a similar claim: “If you just do this one thing, you can experience life as it was meant to be lived.” Wow. That's even better than losing 50 pounds, right? But isn't that just another marketing ploy? 'Clickbait'? Well...

Let's look together at the Gospel of Mark this morning, chapter 12, and listen to Jesus as he talks about that “one thing” above every other “one thing”.

Alternative intro:
What is your life worth?


Loving God is Easy?
- no other gods
- obedience
- surrender
	- Not so easy with a sin nature because our bent is to exalt ourselves and to be like God
		- That is what Adam and Eve did...where they went
	- To love God is to take up our cross daily
		- To follow him regardless of the circumstances that cross our paths
		- To love God is to continue to embrace him to the point where our friends and family start asking questions.
- 

Possible Outline:
1. [[202201081294 Love God]]
2. [[202201081252 Love Others]]




Loving your neighbor
- The opposite of what comes natural
	- Natural is
		- judge your neighbor, covet your neighbor's stuff
- listen to people without responding in the moment
	- seek to understand rather than educate
- Understand who the enemy is.- Jesus' critiques in the NT were regarding the religious leaders
- How does the story of the good samaritan relate to today
	- [[202201231470 Samaritans were outsiders]]

Social media 
- Hackers Podcast
	- Social media has been hacked...from both sides to sow division and discord
	- Not just in the United states, but around the world. It is being used to manipulate large populations of people
		- Think Nazi Germany and propaganda
		- Story of Orson Wells "War of the Worlds"


Who is my neighbor?
- Who would Jesus have used in place of the Samaritan today?
	- the muslim family across the street?
	* the married lesbian couple two houses down?
	* the illegal immigrant working three jobs?
	* the person/group on social media who makes my blood boil?

How do you react when encountering someone different than you?
* Levite/Preist
	* Avoid
	* Ignore
	* These were good people
		* They found good reasons to walk on by
* Samaritan
- all kinds of options

All kinds of wrong with this story
- the samaritan is the good guy - the example of how to live
- The bad guys were the religious leaders of the day
	- These were the "role models" who showed others how to live


[[Jamey Dickens - Price Check]]

A good samaritan is not something to describe a hero...it is a term to describe a Christian...a Jesus follower!

Loving our neighbor means we don't just walk by...


We are called to love people regardless of...
- religion, lifestyle, beliefs, race, nationality

We Judge...
- someone's response
- lack of response
- action 
- lack of action
- Someone's beliefs
	- We are quick to cry heretic
	- We value right thought over people
