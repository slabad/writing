Intro: 
Clickbait
```ad-note
title: Just one thing??
collapse:

Here's how the online claim went, “If you just do this one thing, you can lose 50 pounds in 50 days.” Or wait... maybe it was, “If you just do this one thing, you'll have that 'beach body' in weeks, not months.” I can't remember the exact details, and... I don't know what that “one thing” was or is (probably because I didn't click on the ad). But whatever the promise, what struck me was the marketing strategy involved: 'you can't lose weight (or fill in the blank) because you've made everything too complex and now you're discouraged. But it's actually... all very simple.'

There's something appealing about that claim, isn't there. If we could just simplify things, life would be easier. Well, what if I were to make a similar claim: “If you just do this one thing, you can experience life as it was meant to be lived.” Wow. That's even better than losing 50 pounds, right? But isn't that just another marketing ploy? 'Clickbait'? Well...

Let's look together at the Gospel of Mark this morning, chapter 12, and listen to Jesus as he talks about that “one thing” above every other “one thing”.

Alternative Intro:
Unintended consequences - social media
- talk about the current state of social media
- how it is engineered to drive division


at the end, bring love your neighbor back around




Loving God is Easy?
- no other gods
- obedience
- surrender
	- Not so easy with a sin nature because our bent is to exalt ourselves and to be like God
		- That is what Adam and Eve did...where they went
	- To love God is to take up our cross daily
		- To follow him regardless of the circumstances that cross our paths
		- To love God is to continue to embrace him to the point where our friends and family start asking questions.
- 

Possible Outline:
1. [[202201081294 Love God]]
2. [[202201081252 Love Others]]






Loving your neighbor
- listen to people without responding in the moment
	- seek to understand rather than educate
- Understand who the enemy is.- Jesus' critiques in the NT were regarding the religious leaders
- How does the story of the good samaritan relate to today
	- Samaritans were outsiders 
		- Immigrants/half breeds
		- people who deviated from acceptable cultural norms
		- Regarded as potentially destructive to the status quo
			- considered dangerous to the jewish way of life - 
				- Our kids could be influenced by them!
		- Why were they hated? See [[Why The Jews Hated The Samaritans]]
			- Cultural reasons
				- different religious practices
					- Kind of like Muslims
					- Worshiped Jehovah, but it was mixed up
	- Levite/Priest
		- Insiders
		- Upholders of culture
		- representative of the status quo


Social media 
- Hackers Podcast
	- Social media has been hacked...from both sides to sow division and discord
	- Not just in the United states, but around the world. It is being used to manipulate large populations of people
		- Think Nazi Germany and propaganda
		- Story of Orson Wells "War of the Worlds"


Who is my neighbor?
- Who would Jesus have used in place of the Samaritan today?
	- the muslim family across the street?
	* the married lesbian couple two houses down?
	* the illegal immigrant working three jobs?
	* the person/group on social media who makes my blood boil?

How do you react when encountering someone different than you?
* Levite/Preist
	* Avoid
	* Ignore
* Samaritan
- all kinds of options

All kinds of wrong with this story
- the samaritan is the good guy - the example of how to live
- The bad guys were the religious leaders of the day
	- These were the "role models" who showed others how to live
