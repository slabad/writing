 ### Notes

From the podcast about this:
1. **Context is important** - this question is asked in politically charged environment. For example. Saying "all lives matter" is true and a good thing to say. But to say it in the context of the George Floyd protest made it a politically charged statement.
2. **Nation State is a modern construct** - nation in scripture would be an ethnic group as opposed to a nation state. You could argue that the nation of Israel was both.
