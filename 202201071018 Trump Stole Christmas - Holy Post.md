### notes

Interesting piece on Donald Trump Jr. saying that turning the other cheek isn't working.  See an article on it here:

[[202201070933 DTJ Quote on Turnning the other cheek]]


It is important to take it in context. However, the whole bit shows how American Evangelicals have moved away from the core teachings of Jesus.

Also compelling is the conversation regarding Trump visiting the Baptist Church in Dallas (Jeffers is the pastor I think) and the response to him visiting.  Great example of [[syncretism]] in the south.  One interesting comment was that opposing voices have removed themselves and what is left is those with a new normal of what Christianity looks like.
