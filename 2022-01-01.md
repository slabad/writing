I have decided that it is time to return to journaling. Connor's diagnisis, now a bit more than a month ago has hit me hard.  The first week it felt like it was too much to bear.  The tears did not come at once, not the true tears.  There were some to be sure. But true tears came at moments of dread realization. 

Moments like the time I dropped off Alinea at basketball practice and as I drove past the external doors of the gym and saw the end of the boys practice. The boys were all on the court, all of them except Connor who sat on the sideline watching. Even before Alinea stepped out of the car, my heart broke. As soon as I was alone, the tears came. Lot of them. Massive, uncontrollable sobs the like of which I have only experienced a few times in my life. The enormity of what my son had lost hit me full in the face.

Connor, the cornerstone of the team, its heart and soul, sat on the sideline watching. This was to be his crowning moment. The season started in two days. And he is on the sideline. Naturally athletic in ways I could never be. A basketball standout who had the potential to play college ball. Gifted, yet humble. A leader. Team oriented.

The whys just kept coming. They still do. A month in, I have moved mostly into the acceptance phase, but occasionally revert to anger and more often sadness. The sadness phase was nearly unbarable. And periods of sadness crop up now and again like the night Collette buzzed his head. That was harder than when we did the full shave two days later.

And yet, under it all, that same positive person remains. He walks into a room sill with a cheery "commeer"

Yesterday he was out on the drive shooting baskets when I walked out of the garage. He paused and looked at me with a huge grin. "I still got it." Moments of hope.  Moments of joy. Moments that sustain us. Moments I want to hold in my heart in case we are chosent to walk down the unthinkable path.

I hold onto that 75% survival rate as a promise. Cling to it with hope. And yet the 25% nags at me. The "what ifs" threaten to consume me and overwhelm me with despair.
