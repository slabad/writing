Absolutely sad that some people spend precious time worrying about ageing when there is only one alternative to getting older! Thus, if we are not ageing, we are very dead!! I prefer to age, thanks! :o)

If you are worried about getting old, then don't act like you are: avoid playing bowls and ballroom dancing in old people's homes!
