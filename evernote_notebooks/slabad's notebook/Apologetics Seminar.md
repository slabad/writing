Session 1 Reuben Sairs

Why?

*   Evangelism
    
    *   Offer a credible defense
    
    *   How does my faith hold up under the realities of life?
    *   At some point all of us try to understand our own religious experience

The flagship passage

*   Apologia - Gk.  Give a reasonable defense
*   Note: Part 1.  Defense  Part 2. With gentleness and respect

*   We get ready by thinking about the challenges

Verses Fidiest Love

*   I don't need a reason

*   Ps.. 14:1
*   1 Cor. 2:1-5
    *   Paul at the areopogas
        *   not Jewish environment
        *   no background/context for jewish themes
            *   Start at a more basic place

Beware of Pious Sloth

*   Yes...for many people
    *   can be used as a PIOUS DOGE to do the work of the evangelist
    *   After someone knows you care, you need to answer hard questions

*   Reformulated: How will anyone know that you care enough if you can't articulate your faith?

Apologetics in the scripture hides from us since the word is not used explicitly
However, it is happening.
Acts describes the process

Should a Christian Reason?

*   Dialegomai - dialogue
*   Apologeomai
*   Apologia

To think different things with oneself, to ponder, then with other persons to converse, argue, dispute

What is the balance between faith and reason.

Apologetiics today starts at a different place

*   50 yrs ago, it started at the cross
    *   It? Being? Person? He, she, it?
    *   What is the nature of God?  What are his attributes?
    *   How personal is God?  How interested is he in me?
    *   

General Revelation to Special Revelation  -- a significant jump
A move from general philosophy to specific....moving into the content of the Christian faith

General Revelation

*   Romans 1
*   Ps. 19
*
