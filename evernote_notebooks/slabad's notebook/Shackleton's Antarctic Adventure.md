Small wages. Bitter cold. Long months of complete darkness. Constant danger. Safe return doubtful. Honour and recognition in case of success. —Ernest Shackleton."<br><br>Ice conditions were unusually harsh, and the wooden ship, which Shackleton had renamed _Endurance_ after his family motto, _Fortitudine Vincimus_—"by endurance we conquer," became trapped in the pack ice of the Weddell Sea. For 10 months, the _Endurance_ drifted, locked within the ice, until the pressure crushed the ship. With meager food, clothing and shelter, Shackleton and his men were stranded on the ice floes, where they camped for five months.<br><br>When they had drifted to the northern edge of the pack, encountering open leads of water, the men sailed the three small lifeboats they'd salvaged to a bleak crag called Elephant Island. They were on land for the first time in 497 days; however, it was uninhabited and, due to its distance from shipping lanes, provided no hope for rescue.<br><br>Recognizing the severity of the physical and mental strains on his men, Shackleton and five others immediately set out to take the crew's rescue into their own hands. In a 22-foot lifeboat named the _James Caird,_ they accomplished the impossible, surviving a 17-day, 800-mile journey through the world's worst seas to South Georgia Island, where a whaling station was located.<br><br>The six men landed on an uninhabited part of the island, however, so their last hope was to cross 26 miles of mountains and glaciers, considered impassable, to reach the whaling station on the other side. Starved, frostbitten and wearing rags, Shackleton and two others made the trek and, in August 1916, 21 months after the initial departure of the _Endurance,_ Shackleton himself returned to rescue the men on Elephant Island. Although they'd withstood the most incredible hardship and privation, not one member of the 28-man crew was lost.<br><br>To learn more about the _Endurance_ expedition, visit the NOVA/PBS Online Adventure site by clicking the logo below.<br><br>[![[./_resources/Shackleton's_Antarctic_Adventure.resources/logo-nova.gif]]<br>http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/shackletonexped/1914/](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/shackletonexped/1914/) | ![[./_resources/Shackleton's_Antarctic_Adventure.resources/spacer.gif]] | [![[./_resources/Shackleton's_Antarctic_Adventure.resources/button-home-off.gif]]](http://main.wgbh.org/imax/shackleton/index.html)<br>[![[./_resources/Shackleton's_Antarctic_Adventure.resources/button-about-off.gif]]](http://main.wgbh.org/imax/shackleton/about.html)<br>[![[./_resources/Shackleton's_Antarctic_Adventure.resources/button-sirernest-on.gif]]](http://main.wgbh.org/imax/shackleton/sirernest.html)<br>![[./_resources/Shackleton's_Antarctic_Adventure.resources/white.gif]]<br>[![[./_resources/Shackleton's_Antarctic_Adventure.resources/sirernest-one-off.gif]]](http://main.wgbh.org/imax/shackleton/sirernest-one.html)<br>![[./_resources/Shackleton's_Antarctic_Adventure.resources/white.gif]]<br>[![[./_resources/Shackleton's_Antarctic_Adventure.resources/sirernest-two-off.gif]]](http://main.wgbh.org/imax/shackleton/sirernest-two.html)<br>![[./_resources/Shackleton's_Antarctic_Adventure.resources/white.gif]]<br>[![[./_resources/Shackleton's_Antarctic_Adventure.resources/sirernest-three-off.gif]]](http://main.wgbh.org/imax/shackleton/sirernest-three.html)<br>![[./_resources/Shackleton's_Antarctic_Adventure.resources/white.gif]]<br>[![[./_resources/Shackleton's_Antarctic_Adventure.resources/sirernest-four-off.gif]]](http://main.wgbh.org/imax/shackleton/sirernest-four.html)<br>![[./_resources/Shackleton's_Antarctic_Adventure.resources/white.gif]]<br>[![[./_resources/Shackleton's_Antarctic_Adventure.resources/sirernest-five-off.gif]]](http://main.wgbh.org/imax/shackleton/sirernest-five.html)<br>![[./_resources/Shackleton's_Antarctic_Adventure.resources/white.gif]]<br>[![[./_resources/Shackleton's_Antarctic_Adventure.resources/button-shackleton-off.gif]]](http://main.wgbh.org/imax/shackleton/shackleton.html)<br>[![[./_resources/Shackleton's_Antarctic_Adventure.resources/button-antarctica-off.gif]]](http://main.wgbh.org/imax/shackleton/antarctica.html)<br>[![[./_resources/Shackleton's_Antarctic_Adventure.resources/button-where-off.gif]]](http://main.wgbh.org/imax/shackleton/where.html)<br>![[./_resources/Shackleton's_Antarctic_Adventure.resources/unknown_filename.1.jpeg]] |
