A 2,700-year-old royal seal bearing the mark of the biblical King Hezekiah has been unearthed in Jerusalem.

The tiny oval piece of clay bears the impression of a sun with two wings turned downward, flanked by two ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs that symbolise 'life'.

King Hezekiah's rule was responsible for the rise in power of the Kingdom of Judah and an inscription into the bulla reads 'Belonging to Hezekiah (son of) Ahaz king of Judah'.

The private royal seal, or bulla, belonging to the biblical King Hezekiah (pictured) who ruled the Kingdom of Judah around 2,700 years ago, has been discovered during an excavation of an ancient rubbish dump in Jerusalem. The seal (pictured), which is thought to have been used to seal a document, bears the king's name

It is thought to have originally sealed a document written on papyrus which had been rolled and tied with thin cords, the marks of which can still be seen on the back of the seal.

The seal, which is just a third of an inch across (1cm) and a tenth of an inch thick (0.3cm), is thought to be the first impression belonging to an Israelite or Judean king to be found during an archaeological excavation.

### **WHO WAS KING HEZEKIAH?**

Mentioned in the books of Kings, Isaiah and Chronicles in the Bible, King Hezekiah is regarded as one of the greatest kings of Judah.

He is thought to have ruled between 715BC and 686BC following the death of his father King Ahaz. According to the Hebrew Bible he was 25 when he assumed the throne.

Following the death of the Assyrian king Sargon II, Hezekiah took the opportunity to throw off the subservience of his kingdom to the Assyrians.

He ceased to pay the tribute imposed upon his father and instead allied himself with Egypt.

Sargon's son Sennacherib embarked on a series of attempts to suppress this rebellion which culmulated in the siege of Jerusalem.

Hezekiah's reign is thought to have brought about a notable increase in the power of Judah in the region and it became an important state on the frontier between Assyria and Egpt.

The Hebrew Bible also describes how Hezekiah made a miraculous recovery from a sickness after praying to God. He went on to live for another 15 years.

.

Although other seals that purport to belong to King Hezekiah are known to exist, their provenance has not been confirmed.

The new bulla was discovered during an excavation of an ancient 'rubbish dump' that dates back to the time of King Hezekiah, who lived between 727BC and 698BC.

It could now help provide new clues about the role the Kingdom of Judah played in the region at the time, and helps to underline the importance of King Hezekiah in the history of the region.

Under King Hezekiah, who appears in several books in the Bible, Judah emerged out from under the rule of the Assyrian empire following a series of battles that included the siege of Jerusalem.

During the conflict, Hezekiah allied himself with Egypt, which may help to explain the presence of the ankh symbol – the Egyptian hieroglyphs for life – on his seal.

Judah went on to become one of the most powerful states on the frontier between Egypt and Assyria under Hezekiah.

Dr Eilat Mazar, an archaeologist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem who was leading the excavation, said: 'This is a most unique item - it is the private seal impression of King Hezekiah.

'It is the first time such an item has been found ever in archaeological excavations.

'It is so tiny but we can see very easily the name of King Hezekiah and the symbols he chose to put on his impression.

There is other archaeological evidence for both King Ahaz & King Hezekian but not sure anything existed that proved that Hezekiah was the son of Ahaz in the royal line of the kings of Judah - The ancient Hebrew text on the seal translates as "Belonging to Hezekiah (son of) Ahaz King of Judah" Yet again confirming the Bible as 100% accurate 2 Kings 18:1 ¿¿¿¿

So the seal contains the Egyptian flying Sun-disk of Ra, and the Egyptian ankh-cross. As the book Jesus, Last of the Pharaohs said, the original Judaic religion was substantially Egyptian in nature.

It would be interesting to see what they could find if they were ever allowed to really excavate that area.
