Only decades after the death of the apostles a threefold order of ministry emerged in the form of deacon (minister), presbyter (elder), and bishop (overseer) who were elected from local assemblies of believers. As cities grew to have multiple congregations, bishops developed larger roles as overseers in a specific geographical area. By the third century, church offices had multiplied, and Irenaeus, in the absence of the canon, appealed to apostolic succession as a guarantor of truth in response to the Gnostics. Not everyone, however, emphasized the notion of apostolic succession to the same extent.
