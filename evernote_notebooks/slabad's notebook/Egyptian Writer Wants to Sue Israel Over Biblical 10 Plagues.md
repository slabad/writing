An Egyptian writer has called on his nation to sue the state of Israel over the 10 biblical plagues, including swarming of locusts.

An Egyptian writer has called on his nation to sue the state of Israel over the 10 biblical plagues.

“We want compensation for the plagues that were inflicted upon \[us\] as a result of the curses that the Jews’ ancient forefathers \[cast\] upon our ancient forefathers, who did not deserve to pay for the mistake that Egypt’s ruler at the time, Pharaoh, committed,” columnist Ahmad al-Gamal wrote.

The column was published in the Egyptian daily _Al-Yawm Al-Sabi_ on March 11 but was more recently translated into English by MERMI.

“For what is written in the Torah proves that it was Pharaoh who oppressed the Children of Israel, rather than the Egyptian people,” he added.

Al-Gamal went on to describe the plague as told in the Bible.

“They inflicted upon us the plague of locusts that didn’t leave anything behind them; the plague that transformed the Nile’s waters into blood, so nobody could drink of them for a long time; the plague of darkness that kept the world dark day and night; the plague of frogs; and the plague of the killing of the firstborn, namely every first offspring born to woman or beast, and so on,” he wrote.

“We want compensation for the gold, silver, copper, precious stones, fabrics, hides and lumber, and for \[all\] animal meat, hair, hides and wool, and for other materials that I will mention \[below\], when quoting the language of the Torah. All these are materials that the Jews used in their rituals. These are resources that cannot be found among desert wanderers unless they took them before their departure,” he continued.

The writer also encouraged suing Turkey for the Ottoman occupation, France for Napoleon’s invasion and Britain for its colonial rule, [The Blaze reports](http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/04/01/egyptian-columnist-apparently-wants-to-sue-israel-overthe-10-plagues/).
