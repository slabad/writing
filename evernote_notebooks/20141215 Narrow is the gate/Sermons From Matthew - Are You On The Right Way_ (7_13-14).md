> >                   Are You On The Right Way? (7:13-14)**
> > 
> > **INTRODUCTION**
> > 
> > 1. Everyone is on a spiritual journey as they travel through life...
> >    a. Whether religious or not, we travel a spiritual path
> >    b. Every day we make choices that affects the direction in which we
> >       are headed
> > 
> > 2. Many people think that the paths we can travel are many...
> >    a. In one sense that may be true; there are all kinds of religions
> >    b. But in another sense there are really only two paths or ways
> > 
> > 3. In His sermon on the mount, Jesus spoke of these two ways - **Mt 7:
> >    13-14**
> >    a. Each with its own beginning, each with its own end
> >    b. One way is heavily populated, the other is traveled by few
> > 
> > 4. Where are you in your spiritual sojourn?
> >    a. Are you on the right way?
> >    b. Are you heading in the right direction?
> > 
> > \[To answer such questions, let's look closely at what Jesus said.  Note
> > first that...\]
> > 
> > **I. THERE ARE TWO GATES**
> > 
> >    **A. THE WIDE GATE...**
> >       1. **"for wide is the gate..." - [Mt 7:13](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%207.13)**
> >       2. This "gate" represents the beginning to the "way" that leads
> >          to destruction
> >       3. It is described as "wide"; evidently it is a gate which:
> >          a. Allows many to enter with no sacrifice on their part
> >             1) It does not require giving up anything
> >             2) One is allowed to bring along whatever "baggage" they
> >                desire
> >                a) E.g., materialism
> >                b) E.g., prejudice, hatred, an unforgiving spirit
> >                c) E.g., believe whatever one wants to believe
> >          b. Is therefore chosen by most people
> >             1) For there are no restrictions concerning belief and
> >                behavior
> >             2) It also opens the way to "the path of least resistance"
> > 
> >    **B. THE NARROW GATE...**
> >       1. **"Enter by the narrow gate.." - [Mt 7:13](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%207.13)**
> >       2. This "gate" represents the beginning, or starting point, to
> >          the "way" that leads to life
> >       3. Why is it "narrow"?  Because it is a gate which:
> >          a. Requires self-denial and obedience - cf. **[Mt 16:24](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%2016.24)**
> >          b. Has no room for...
> >             1) A consuming desire for earthly goods - **[Mt 6:19-20](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%206.19-20)**
> >             2) An unforgiving spirit - **[Mt 6:14-15](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%206.14-15)**
> >             3) Self-righteousness - **[Mt 6:1](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%206.1)**
> >             -- As Jesus has already stressed in His sermon on the mount
> > 
> > \[These two "gates" are only the starting points.  Let's now take a
> > closer look at the fact that...\]
> > 
> > **II. THERE ARE TWO WAYS**
> > 
> >    **A. THE BROAD WAY...**
> >       1. **"...broad is the way" - [Mt 7:13](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%207.13)**
> >       2. The way that leads to destruction is broad because it allows:
> >          a. Any behavior one desires
> >          b. No need for reformation or changes in one's "lifestyle"
> >       3. Many people love this path
> >          a. They think they are "free"
> >          b. They believe they are "open-minded"
> >          c. They view themselves as "tolerant" of others in this same
> >             way
> > 
> >    **B. THE CONSTRICTED WAY...**
> >       1. **"...difficult is the way" - [Mt 7:14](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%207.14)** (NKJV)
> >          a. "...narrow the road" (NIV)
> >          b. "the way is narrow" (NASB)
> >          c. "narrow is the way" (KJV)
> >          -- The picture is one of a narrow and difficult path between
> >             two cliffs
> >       2. The way that leads to life is "difficult" because it requires:
> >          a. A righteousness that exceeds that of many religious people
> >             - **[Mt 5:20](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%205.20)**
> >          b. A change in our behavior - cf. **[Mt 5:21-7:12](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%205.21-7.12)**
> >       3. Because of its difficulty, many choose not to travel its path
> >          a. They think it too "confining"
> >          b. They think it is too "narrow-minded"
> > 
> > \[As Jesus describes the two gates and the two ways, He also reminds us
> > that...\]
> > 
> > **III. THERE ARE TWO GROUPS**
> > 
> >    **A. THE MANY...**
> >       1. **"There are many who go in by it" - [Mt 7:13](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%207.13)**
> >       2. We have seen reasons why this is so:
> >          a. The entrance is wide:  "Come as you are!  No changes
> >             necessary!"
> >          b. The way is broad:  "Make your own rules!  Believe what you
> >             want!  Do what you want!"
> >       3. This is the way people travel by default;  unless they are
> >          actively seeking the narrow path, this is the one they will
> >          travel
> > 
> >    **B. THE FEW...**
> >       1. **"there are few who find it" - [Mt 7:14](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%207.14)**
> >       2. As proven true so often in the past, only few will be saved
> >          a. E.g., the millions lost in the flood vs. the eight saved on
> >             the ark
> >          b. E.g., the hundreds of thousands lost in the wilderness vs.
> >             the two who entered the promised land
> >          -- So Jesus warned on another occasion - **[Lk 13:23-24](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Lk%2013.23-24)**
> >       3. That it must be "found" suggests effort must extended
> >          a. As Jesus said in **[Lk 13:24](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Lk%2013.24):  "Strive to enter through the
> >             narrow gate..."**
> >          b. Even then not all will be saved:  **"...for many, I say to
> >             you, will seek to enter and will not be able."**
> >          -- Not just effort, but the right kind of effort - cf. **[Mt 5:6](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%205.6);
> >             [6:33](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%206.33)**
> > 
> > \[Finally, we note that Jesus tells us that...\]
> > 
> > **IV. THERE ARE TWO DESTINATIONS**
> > 
> >    **A. DESTRUCTION...**
> >       1. **"...broad is the way that leads to destruction" - [Mt 7:13](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%207.13)**
> >       2. Paul wrote of the "everlasting destruction" that is to come
> >          - **[2Th 1:7-9](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/2Th%201.7-9)**
> >          a. Upon those who know not God
> >          b. Upon those who obey not the gospel of Jesus Christ
> >       3. John described it as "a lake of fire" - **[Re 20:15](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Re%2020.15); [21:8](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Re%2021.8)**
> >       -- A most sobering thought are these words of Jesus:  **"...there
> >          are many who go in by it." - [Mt 7:13](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%207.13)**
> > 
> >    **B. LIFE...**
> >       1. **"...difficult is the way which leads to life" - [Mt 7:14](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%207.14)**
> >       2. This "life" is the "everlasting life" received at the judgment
> >          - **[Mt 25:46](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%2025.46)**
> >       3. It is the "gift of God", given at the end - **[Ro 6:22-23](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Ro%206.22-23)**
> >          a. To those who have been set free from sin - cf. **[Ro 6:3-7](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Ro%206.3-7)**
> >          b. To those who became slaves of God and of righteousness
> >             - cf. **[Ro 6:17-18](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Ro%206.17-18)**
> >          c. To those who bore the fruit of holiness - cf. **[Ro 6:20-22](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Ro%206.20-22)**
> >       -- Another sobering thought are these words about the way that
> >          leads to this life: **"...there are few who find it." - [Mt 7:14](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%207.14)**
> > 
> > **CONCLUSION**
> > 
> > 1. So we have seen that Jesus describes:
> >    a. Two gates
> >    b. Two ways
> >    c. Two groups
> >    d. Two destinations
> > 
> > 2. Are there many roads that lead to heaven?
> >    a. Many people like to think so
> >    b. That all religions lead to heaven
> >    c. That it really doesn't matter what you believe or do, as long as
> >       you are sincere
> > 
> > 3. But according to Jesus...
> >    a. There are only two roads (ways)
> >    b. One leads to life, i.e., heaven
> >    c. The other road, filled with many people with many different
> >       beliefs, leads to destruction!
> > 
> > 4. Are you on the right way, the only way, that leads to life?
> >    a. Jesus said, **"I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes
> >       to the Father except through Me." - [Jn 14:6](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Jn%2014.6)**
> >    b. The way that He provides is a narrow one, for He requires that
> >       people keep His commandments - **[Mt 28:19-20](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%2028.19-20)**
> > 
> > Will you be among the few, or the many?  Let Jesus direct you along the
> > narrow way that leads to eternal life!

> > 
> > 2. Are there many roads that lead to heaven?
> >    a. Many people like to think so
> >    b. That all religions lead to heaven
> >    c. That it really doesn't matter what you believe or do, as long as
> >       you are sincere
> > 
> > 3. But according to Jesus...
> >    a. There are only two roads (ways)
> >    b. One leads to life, i.e., heaven
> >    c. The other road, filled with many people with many different
> >       beliefs, leads to destruction!
> > 
> > 4. Are you on the right way, the only way, that leads to life?
> >    a. Jesus said, **"I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes
> >       to the Father except through Me." - [Jn 14:6](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Jn%2014.6)**
> >    b. The way that He provides is a narrow one, for He requires that
> >       people keep His commandments - **[Mt 28:19-20](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%2028.19-20)**
> > 
> > Will you be among the few, or the many?  Let Jesus direct you along the

> >                   Are You On The Right Way? (7:13-14)**
> > 
> > **INTRODUCTION**
> > 
> > 1. Everyone is on a spiritual journey as they travel through life...
> >    a. Whether religious or not, we travel a spiritual path
> >    b. Every day we make choices that affects the direction in which we
> >       are headed
> > 
> > 2. Many people think that the paths we can travel are many...
> >    a. In one sense that may be true; there are all kinds of religions
> >    b. But in another sense there are really only two paths or ways
> > 
> > 3. In His sermon on the mount, Jesus spoke of these two ways - **Mt 7:
> >    13-14**
> >    a. Each with its own beginning, each with its own end
> >    b. One way is heavily populated, the other is traveled by few
> > 
> > 4. Where are you in your spiritual sojourn?
> >    a. Are you on the right way?
> >    b. Are you heading in the right direction?
> > 
> > \[To answer such questions, let's look closely at what Jesus said.  Note
> > first that...\]
> > 
> > **I. THERE ARE TWO GATES**
> > 
> >    **A. THE WIDE GATE...**
> >       1. **"for wide is the gate..." - [Mt 7:13](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%207.13)**
> >       2. This "gate" represents the beginning to the "way" that leads
> >          to destruction
> >       3. It is described as "wide"; evidently it is a gate which:
> >          a. Allows many to enter with no sacrifice on their part
> >             1) It does not require giving up anything
> >             2) One is allowed to bring along whatever "baggage" they
> >                desire
> >                a) E.g., materialism
> >                b) E.g., prejudice, hatred, an unforgiving spirit
> >                c) E.g., believe whatever one wants to believe
> >          b. Is therefore chosen by most people
> >             1) For there are no restrictions concerning belief and
> >                behavior
> >             2) It also opens the way to "the path of least resistance"
> > 
> >    **B. THE NARROW GATE...**
> >       1. **"Enter by the narrow gate.." - [Mt 7:13](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%207.13)**
> >       2. This "gate" represents the beginning, or starting point, to
> >          the "way" that leads to life
> >       3. Why is it "narrow"?  Because it is a gate which:
> >          a. Requires self-denial and obedience - cf. **[Mt 16:24](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%2016.24)**
> >          b. Has no room for...
> >             1) A consuming desire for earthly goods - **[Mt 6:19-20](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%206.19-20)**
> >             2) An unforgiving spirit - **[Mt 6:14-15](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%206.14-15)**
> >             3) Self-righteousness - **[Mt 6:1](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%206.1)**
> >             -- As Jesus has already stressed in His sermon on the mount
> > 
> > \[These two "gates" are only the starting points.  Let's now take a
> > closer look at the fact that...\]
> > 
> > **II. THERE ARE TWO WAYS**
> > 
> >    **A. THE BROAD WAY...**
> >       1. **"...broad is the way" - [Mt 7:13](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%207.13)**
> >       2. The way that leads to destruction is broad because it allows:
> >          a. Any behavior one desires
> >          b. No need for reformation or changes in one's "lifestyle"
> >       3. Many people love this path
> >          a. They think they are "free"
> >          b. They believe they are "open-minded"
> >          c. They view themselves as "tolerant" of others in this same
> >             way
> > 
> >    **B. THE CONSTRICTED WAY...**
> >       1. **"...difficult is the way" - [Mt 7:14](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%207.14)** (NKJV)
> >          a. "...narrow the road" (NIV)
> >          b. "the way is narrow" (NASB)
> >          c. "narrow is the way" (KJV)
> >          -- The picture is one of a narrow and difficult path between
> >             two cliffs
> >       2. The way that leads to life is "difficult" because it requires:
> >          a. A righteousness that exceeds that of many religious people
> >             - **[Mt 5:20](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%205.20)**
> >          b. A change in our behavior - cf. **[Mt 5:21-7:12](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%205.21-7.12)**
> >       3. Because of its difficulty, many choose not to travel its path
> >          a. They think it too "confining"
> >          b. They think it is too "narrow-minded"
> > 
> > \[As Jesus describes the two gates and the two ways, He also reminds us
> > that...\]
> > 
> > **III. THERE ARE TWO GROUPS**
> > 
> >    **A. THE MANY...**
> >       1. **"There are many who go in by it" - [Mt 7:13](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%207.13)**
> >       2. We have seen reasons why this is so:
> >          a. The entrance is wide:  "Come as you are!  No changes
> >             necessary!"
> >          b. The way is broad:  "Make your own rules!  Believe what you
> >             want!  Do what you want!"
> >       3. This is the way people travel by default;  unless they are
> >          actively seeking the narrow path, this is the one they will
> >          travel
> > 
> >    **B. THE FEW...**
> >       1. **"there are few who find it" - [Mt 7:14](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%207.14)**
> >       2. As proven true so often in the past, only few will be saved
> >          a. E.g., the millions lost in the flood vs. the eight saved on
> >             the ark
> >          b. E.g., the hundreds of thousands lost in the wilderness vs.
> >             the two who entered the promised land
> >          -- So Jesus warned on another occasion - **[Lk 13:23-24](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Lk%2013.23-24)**
> >       3. That it must be "found" suggests effort must extended
> >          a. As Jesus said in **[Lk 13:24](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Lk%2013.24):  "Strive to enter through the
> >             narrow gate..."**
> >          b. Even then not all will be saved:  **"...for many, I say to
> >             you, will seek to enter and will not be able."**
> >          -- Not just effort, but the right kind of effort - cf. **[Mt 5:6](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%205.6);
> >             [6:33](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%206.33)**
> > 
> > \[Finally, we note that Jesus tells us that...\]
> > 
> > **IV. THERE ARE TWO DESTINATIONS**
> > 
> >    **A. DESTRUCTION...**
> >       1. **"...broad is the way that leads to destruction" - [Mt 7:13](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%207.13)**
> >       2. Paul wrote of the "everlasting destruction" that is to come
> >          - **[2Th 1:7-9](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/2Th%201.7-9)**
> >          a. Upon those who know not God
> >          b. Upon those who obey not the gospel of Jesus Christ
> >       3. John described it as "a lake of fire" - **[Re 20:15](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Re%2020.15); [21:8](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Re%2021.8)**
> >       -- A most sobering thought are these words of Jesus:  **"...there
> >          are many who go in by it." - [Mt 7:13](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%207.13)**
> > 
> >    **B. LIFE...**
> >       1. **"...difficult is the way which leads to life" - [Mt 7:14](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%207.14)**
> >       2. This "life" is the "everlasting life" received at the judgment
> >          - **[Mt 25:46](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%2025.46)**
> >       3. It is the "gift of God", given at the end - **[Ro 6:22-23](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Ro%206.22-23)**
> >          a. To those who have been set free from sin - cf. **[Ro 6:3-7](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Ro%206.3-7)**
> >          b. To those who became slaves of God and of righteousness
> >             - cf. **[Ro 6:17-18](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Ro%206.17-18)**

> > 
> > 1. So we have seen that Jesus describes:
> >    a. Two gates
> >    b. Two ways
> >    c. Two groups
> >    d. Two destinations
> > 
> > 2. Are there many roads that lead to heaven?
> >    a. Many people like to think so
> >    b. That all religions lead to heaven
> >    c. That it really doesn't matter what you believe or do, as long as
> >       you are sincere
> > 
> > 3. But according to Jesus...
> >    a. There are only two roads (ways)
> >    b. One leads to life, i.e., heaven
> >    c. The other road, filled with many people with many different
> >       beliefs, leads to destruction!
> > 
> > 4. Are you on the right way, the only way, that leads to life?
> >    a. Jesus said, **"I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes
> >       to the Father except through Me." - [Jn 14:6](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Jn%2014.6)**
> >    b. The way that He provides is a narrow one, for He requires that
> >       people keep His commandments - **[Mt 28:19-20](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%2028.19-20)**

> > Will you be among the few, or the many?  Let Jesus direct you along the

> >                   Are You On The Right Way? (7:13-14)**
> > 
> > **INTRODUCTION**
> > 
> > 1. Everyone is on a spiritual journey as they travel through life...
> >    a. Whether religious or not, we travel a spiritual path
> >    b. Every day we make choices that affects the direction in which we
> >       are headed
> > 
> > 2. Many people think that the paths we can travel are many...
> >    a. In one sense that may be true; there are all kinds of religions
> >    b. But in another sense there are really only two paths or ways
> > 
> > 3. In His sermon on the mount, Jesus spoke of these two ways - **Mt 7:
> >    13-14**
> >    a. Each with its own beginning, each with its own end
> >    b. One way is heavily populated, the other is traveled by few
> > 
> > 4. Where are you in your spiritual sojourn?
> >    a. Are you on the right way?
> >    b. Are you heading in the right direction?
> > 
> > \[To answer such questions, let's look closely at what Jesus said.  Note
> > first that...\]
> > 
> > **I. THERE ARE TWO GATES**
> > 
> >    **A. THE WIDE GATE...**
> >       1. **"for wide is the gate..." - [Mt 7:13](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%207.13)**
> >       2. This "gate" represents the beginning to the "way" that leads
> >          to destruction
> >       3. It is described as "wide"; evidently it is a gate which:
> >          a. Allows many to enter with no sacrifice on their part
> >             1) It does not require giving up anything
> >             2) One is allowed to bring along whatever "baggage" they
> >                desire
> >                a) E.g., materialism
> >                b) E.g., prejudice, hatred, an unforgiving spirit
> >                c) E.g., believe whatever one wants to believe
> >          b. Is therefore chosen by most people
> >             1) For there are no restrictions concerning belief and
> >                behavior
> >             2) It also opens the way to "the path of least resistance"
> > 
> >    **B. THE NARROW GATE...**
> >       1. **"Enter by the narrow gate.." - [Mt 7:13](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%207.13)**
> >       2. This "gate" represents the beginning, or starting point, to
> >          the "way" that leads to life
> >       3. Why is it "narrow"?  Because it is a gate which:
> >          a. Requires self-denial and obedience - cf. **[Mt 16:24](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%2016.24)**
> >          b. Has no room for...
> >             1) A consuming desire for earthly goods - **[Mt 6:19-20](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%206.19-20)**
> >             2) An unforgiving spirit - **[Mt 6:14-15](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%206.14-15)**
> >             3) Self-righteousness - **[Mt 6:1](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%206.1)**
> >             -- As Jesus has already stressed in His sermon on the mount
> > 
> > \[These two "gates" are only the starting points.  Let's now take a

> > 
> > **II. THERE ARE TWO WAYS**
> > 
> >    **A. THE BROAD WAY...**
> >       1. **"...broad is the way" - [Mt 7:13](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%207.13)**
> >       2. The way that leads to destruction is broad because it allows:
> >          a. Any behavior one desires
> >          b. No need for reformation or changes in one's "lifestyle"
> >       3. Many people love this path
> >          a. They think they are "free"
> >          b. They believe they are "open-minded"
> >          c. They view themselves as "tolerant" of others in this same
> >             way
> > 
> >    **B. THE CONSTRICTED WAY...**
> >       1. **"...difficult is the way" - [Mt 7:14](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%207.14)** (NKJV)
> >          a. "...narrow the road" (NIV)
> >          b. "the way is narrow" (NASB)
> >          c. "narrow is the way" (KJV)
> >          -- The picture is one of a narrow and difficult path between
> >             two cliffs
> >       2. The way that leads to life is "difficult" because it requires:
> >          a. A righteousness that exceeds that of many religious people
> >             - **[Mt 5:20](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%205.20)**
> >          b. A change in our behavior - cf. **[Mt 5:21-7:12](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%205.21-7.12)**
> >       3. Because of its difficulty, many choose not to travel its path
> >          a. They think it too "confining"
> >          b. They think it is too "narrow-minded"
> > 
> > \[As Jesus describes the two gates and the two ways, He also reminds us
> > that...\]
> > 
> > **III. THERE ARE TWO GROUPS**
> > 
> >    **A. THE MANY...**
> >       1. **"There are many who go in by it" - [Mt 7:13](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%207.13)**

> >          b. The way is broad:  "Make your own rules!  Believe what you

> >          b. Has no room for...
> >             1) A consuming desire for earthly goods - **[Mt 6:19-20](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%206.19-20)**
> >             2) An unforgiving spirit - **[Mt 6:14-15](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%206.14-15)**
> >             3) Self-righteousness - **[Mt 6:1](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%206.1)**
> >             -- As Jesus has already stressed in His sermon on the mount

> > **II. THERE ARE TWO WAYS**
> > 
> >    **A. THE BROAD WAY...**
> >       1. **"...broad is the way" - [Mt 7:13](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%207.13)**
> >       2. The way that leads to destruction is broad because it allows:
> >          a. Any behavior one desires
> >          b. No need for reformation or changes in one's "lifestyle"
> >       3. Many people love this path
> >          a. They think they are "free"
> >          b. They believe they are "open-minded"
> >          c. They view themselves as "tolerant" of others in this same
> >             way
> > 
> >    **B. THE CONSTRICTED WAY...**
> >       1. **"...difficult is the way" - [Mt 7:14](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%207.14)** (NKJV)
> >          a. "...narrow the road" (NIV)
> >          b. "the way is narrow" (NASB)
> >          c. "narrow is the way" (KJV)
> >          -- The picture is one of a narrow and difficult path between
> >             two cliffs
> >       2. The way that leads to life is "difficult" because it requires:
> >          a. A righteousness that exceeds that of many religious people
> >             - **[Mt 5:20](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%205.20)**
> >          b. A change in our behavior - cf. **[Mt 5:21-7:12](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%205.21-7.12)**
> >       3. Because of its difficulty, many choose not to travel its path
> >          a. They think it too "confining"
> >          b. They think it is too "narrow-minded"
> > 
> > \[As Jesus describes the two gates and the two ways, He also reminds us
> > that...\]
> > 
> > **III. THERE ARE TWO GROUPS**
> > 
> >    **A. THE MANY...**
> >       1. **"There are many who go in by it" - [Mt 7:13](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%207.13)**
> >       2. We have seen reasons why this is so:
> >          a. The entrance is wide:  "Come as you are!  No changes
> >             necessary!"
> >          b. The way is broad:  "Make your own rules!  Believe what you
> >             want!  Do what you want!"
> >       3. This is the way people travel by default;  unless they are
> >          actively seeking the narrow path, this is the one they will
> >          travel
> > 
> >    **B. THE FEW...**
> >       1. **"there are few who find it" - [Mt 7:14](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%207.14)**
> >       2. As proven true so often in the past, only few will be saved
> >          a. E.g., the millions lost in the flood vs. the eight saved on
> >             the ark
> >          b. E.g., the hundreds of thousands lost in the wilderness vs.
> >             the two who entered the promised land
> >          -- So Jesus warned on another occasion - **[Lk 13:23-24](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Lk%2013.23-24)**
> >       3. That it must be "found" suggests effort must extended
> >          a. As Jesus said in **[Lk 13:24](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Lk%2013.24):  "Strive to enter through the
> >             narrow gate..."**
> >          b. Even then not all will be saved:  **"...for many, I say to
> >             you, will seek to enter and will not be able."**
> >          -- Not just effort, but the right kind of effort - cf. **[Mt 5:6](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%205.6);
> >             [6:33](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%206.33)**
> > 
> > \[Finally, we note that Jesus tells us that...\]
> > 
> > **IV. THERE ARE TWO DESTINATIONS**
> > 
> >    **A. DESTRUCTION...**
> >       1. **"...broad is the way that leads to destruction" - [Mt 7:13](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%207.13)**
> >       2. Paul wrote of the "everlasting destruction" that is to come
> >          - **[2Th 1:7-9](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/2Th%201.7-9)**
> >          a. Upon those who know not God
> >          b. Upon those who obey not the gospel of Jesus Christ
> >       3. John described it as "a lake of fire" - **[Re 20:15](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Re%2020.15); [21:8](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Re%2021.8)**
> >       -- A most sobering thought are these words of Jesus:  **"...there
> >          are many who go in by it." - [Mt 7:13](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%207.13)**
> > 
> >    **B. LIFE...**
> >       1. **"...difficult is the way which leads to life" - [Mt 7:14](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%207.14)**
> >       2. This "life" is the "everlasting life" received at the judgment
> >          - **[Mt 25:46](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%2025.46)**
> >       3. It is the "gift of God", given at the end - **[Ro 6:22-23](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Ro%206.22-23)**
> >          a. To those who have been set free from sin - cf. **[Ro 6:3-7](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Ro%206.3-7)**
> >          b. To those who became slaves of God and of righteousness
> >             - cf. **[Ro 6:17-18](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Ro%206.17-18)**
> >          c. To those who bore the fruit of holiness - cf. **[Ro 6:20-22](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Ro%206.20-22)**
> >       -- Another sobering thought are these words about the way that
> >          leads to this life: **"...there are few who find it." - [Mt 7:14](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%207.14)**
> > 
> > **CONCLUSION**
> > 
> > 1. So we have seen that Jesus describes:
> >    a. Two gates
> >    b. Two ways
> >    c. Two groups
> >    d. Two destinations
> > 
> > 2. Are there many roads that lead to heaven?
> >    a. Many people like to think so
> >    b. That all religions lead to heaven
> >    c. That it really doesn't matter what you believe or do, as long as
> >       you are sincere
> > 
> > 3. But according to Jesus...
> >    a. There are only two roads (ways)
> >    b. One leads to life, i.e., heaven
> >    c. The other road, filled with many people with many different
> >       beliefs, leads to destruction!
> > 
> > 4. Are you on the right way, the only way, that leads to life?
> >    a. Jesus said, **"I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes
> >       to the Father except through Me." - [Jn 14:6](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Jn%2014.6)**
> >    b. The way that He provides is a narrow one, for He requires that
> >       people keep His commandments - **[Mt 28:19-20](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%2028.19-20)**
> > 
> > Will you be among the few, or the many?  Let Jesus direct you along the
> > narrow way that leads to eternal life!
