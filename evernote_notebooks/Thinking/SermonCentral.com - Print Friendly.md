Have you ever seen the movie, “We Were Soldiers?” It is a true story of 400 American troops who in November of 1965 face off with 2,000 enemy troops. The backdrop is the Vietnam War and Cornel Moore, played by Mel Gibson has been training his group of new recruits to go fight. They are green and unprepared for what lies ahead of them.
They have left family and friends to go fight an enemy in a place most of them have never heard of and tragically where the majority of them will not come home from.
As they prepare to engage the enemy, their Cornel addresses them. His desire is to encourage and instill confidence in them and to share with them the goal he has as they enter the battle. Hear his words to the men under his command.

The Cornel did not promise that it would be easy. Some of the men would not make it, but he did state before his men his goal. “I will be the first to set foot on the field and I will be the last to step off and I will leave no one behind. Dead or alive, we will all come home together. So help me God.”
\- Goals have the power to motivate us and to challenge us. What is your goal as a Christian? Is it focused, specific and able to be measured? Are you willing to die for it - die to self and to sin?
