 Amy Carmichael had brown eyes – and that was a problem because she desperately wanted pretty blue Irish eyes. Her mother told her that God answered prayer. So one night before going to bed she prayed that God would give her blue eyes. When she woke up the next morning she rushed to a mirror to see her new blue eyes – only to be disappointed because her eyes were still brown. Her crying brought the attention of her mother. When Amy explained about her prayer her mother said, “God always answers prayer but sometimes He says no. If God made you with brown eyes then He has a reason for that. Maybe one day you’ll understand but then again we may never know why God makes us the way He did or allows things to happen to us. We just have to trust Him because He knows what’s best.
