[Leadership](http://www.inc.com/will-yakowicz/3-skills-you-need-to-lead-your-company.html) is lonely. No matter how big your team, sometimes it's just you--which means you sometimes need to look inside yourself for motivation and inspiration.

Or you can find personal inspiration from someone who has been there, done that...and done it well.

Here are some of my favorite leadership quotes. Tweet them, share them, but most important, use them to help you become an even better leader than you already are.
