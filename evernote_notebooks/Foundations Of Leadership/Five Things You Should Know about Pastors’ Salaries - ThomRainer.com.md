In many churches, the pastor’s salary is a quiet issue. There is a sense of discomfort from both the pastor and the members when the topic is broached. Such discomfort is unfortunate, however, because a number of churches will not seek every year to make certain the pastor is paid fairly.

A couple of prefatory comments are in order. First, we all know of the extreme examples of pastors living lavishly or mismanaging money. Those stories, though true, represent a small minority. Most pastors are not overpaid. And most pastors manage their limited finances well. Second, I am aware that many people are unemployed and that anyone who has a job should be grateful. That is still not a good reason to pay a pastor unfairly. As a final note, this brief article is relevant to all paid church staff, though my focus is here on the pastor.

In my 25 years of consulting and working with churches, I have discovered five common issues that are not always known by most church members. And lack of awareness of any one of these issues can have a detrimental impact on fair compensation for the pastor.

1.  **A pay or compensation package is not the same as a salary.** I cringe when I hear churches state a package to be the pay for the pastor. The package includes benefits such as health insurance and expense reimbursements such as business use of the automobile. No worker in a secular company adds their benefits and expenses and calls it their pay. Anything other than the cash payment (before taxes) the pastor receives should be reported in a totally separate category.

2.  **There are many resources to find out what the fair compensation for a pastor should be.** Many denominations provide their own compensation studies. But you can do an Internet search for “pastor pay” and see a plethora of resources that are available. And as a rule of thumb, you could seek to estimate what the mean income is for families in the church, and use that as a basis for compensation for the pastor. Churches that do not do their homework on pastoral compensation tend to underpay their pastors.

3.  **Many pastors request no raises but would still appreciate one.** Some pastors simply don’t want to deal with a critic who might question any raise given to a pastor. Others feel extremely uncomfortable talking about money in general, and use the “no raise” request to deflect further conversation. Some think it’s just the noble thing to do. But most pastors, in reality, would appreciate a fair raise to keep up with growing expenses. Don’t accept their requests as the last word.

4.  **Many pastors are under extreme stress because they do not have adequate income to meet their financial obligations.** Like anyone else who is under heavy financial burdens, a pastor can find his thoughts consumed with worry. Because he is so distracted, he naturally is less effective in his ministry. Both he and his family feel the pressure.

5.  **Some pastors leave their churches because of pay issues.** You will not likely hear a pastor announce in his resignation that he is leaving because of financial pressures. The reality is that, for a number of pastors, the issue of compensation is a major push from one church to another, or from the church to a secular vocation. It’s not that the pastor is in his job for the money; it’s that the compensation for his vocation is insufficient to meet his family’s needs.

Paul wrote these words to his young protégé, Timothy, in 1 Timothy 5:17-18: “_The elders who are good leaders should be considered worthy of an ample honorarium, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching. For the Scripture says, ‘Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain and, the worker is worthy of his wages’_” (HCSB).

It is unfortunate that the few indulgent pastors who live lavish lifestyles get most of the attention. The reality is that most of the some 400,000 pastors in America are not overpaid; indeed many are underpaid. Those are the pastors who need our attention.

    Robbin –
    
    Auto expenses are a direct expense reimbursement and should never be confused with basic compensation. I would advise against including the amounts in the same check.

    Robbin,
    Absolutely, mileage should be a seperate check. Please, tell me it is handled as a reimbursement (no taxes paid), not an addition to base pay.

    I don’t get paid for using my spiritual gifts, nor should anyone. We are all to contribute so that no one is overworked. A “love gift” for going above and beyond is in order, but the modern day, paid pastor is unbiblical!

    Sandy the Bible says that people who labor in preaching and teaching should be worthy of double-honor (double compensation) and in the same context it says the laborer is worthy of his wages, and also “you shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain”. (one who works for something should be able to benefit from it). It is true that Paul says in 1 Corinthians he presents the Gospel free of charge, but in the same passage he also says that what he is doing is revoking His right of the gospel. We can see based on these evidences that he is speaking a descriptive truth rather than a prescriptive truth, and that it is the full right of the pastor, biblically speaking, to get compensated well for what he is doing. Pastors work nonstop, taking phone calls all day, preaching, giving advice, and so many other things that the congregation doesn’t see. If he did not get paid for doing it then he would not be able to focus all his attention to the mission of the church, hence “muzzling an ox when it treads out the grain”.

    Early American settlers were mostly poor yeoman farmers and so were the preachers. These men of God did have regular jobs but also felt called to lead the local congregation. Generally, the pastors were paid very little to nothing in most towns. The people of the community did give them respect and often invited them over for dinner and other festive activities. This seems very inadequate in our current society but has a simplistic and biblical sense to it. The church (the body of believers) were more involved and responsible for the health and well-being of the church. The church survived and flourished because most members pitched in to help keep the church/community strong.
    
    Church members need to volunteer themselves more to the point that paid employees are simply not needed. We have so many paid church employees because somewhere along the way we decided to give money instead of time to the church. This is the true problem. Not church salaries but the laziness of church members.
    
    The church is not a social club designed to make us feel better. We need to be willing to roll up our sleeves and get to work for our churches and communities.

    Hello Kevin,
    
    Being worthy of double-honor is NOT double compensation. The Greek word for honor here is “time” and should be interpreted high esteem, respect or honor. Similarly, it should be interpreted as high esteem in 1 Timothy 6:1, “Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all HONOR, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.” The greek word that seems to fit the interpretation “compensation” is “timao”, which is used in 1 Timothy 5:3, “HONOR widows that are widows indeed.
    
    1 Timothy 5:17-18 says, “Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially they who labor in the word and doctrine. For the scripture says, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn. And, The laborer is worthy of his reward.” Therefore the interpretation in context appears to be that as the ox deserves not to be muzzled & the laborer deserves wages, so then an elder that rules well deserves double esteem.
    
    If a pastor feels his compensation through the offering of the saints is inadequate he should find another means of compensation that will not cause believers or non believers to stumble. For whoever stumbles one of Christ’s, it would be better if a mill stone were hung around his neck and he be cast into the sea. Our vocation as Christians should be to present the gospel without hypocrisy & burden on others. The moment that anyone questions your motives suggesting things like “money”, the gospel of Christ will be dishonored.

    Wow Destiny, this is perhaps one of the most short sighted things I have read in a while. I do not say that to be mean, but wow. I know that pastors can seem like they are well compensated because of the scandals and TV programs out there, but the reality is, and you can research this if you want, Pastors are consistently the least paid position for the amount of education they desire. For example, I have 11 years of school, and have never had a dime of help from the church to pay for it, though they benefit from it regularly. Also, when I applied for benefits, I found out that I am in the 212% of poverty for my town. And I live in a pretty blue collar town- and I am making more than I have ever made in ministry. We have a part time staff that is raising a family of 6 for 36K per year. I guarantee that is far beyond your lifestyle. So, no, we are not entitled. But most of us are educated to the degree that we could make way more in any other field. Not to mention all of the areas of compensation we are not given. I do not have a retirement fund, life insurance, and have the cheapest health insurance possible. I have driven cars that break down my whole life, and have a growing family. I am the lowest paid family my size in my congregation by at least 30K per year, yet have the second most time spent in education, and have 13 years experience in my job. Is that fair?

    Destiny with all due respect your logic and exegesis is quite flawed.
    
    I am a pastor. I went to school for 8 years to learn and become qualified for this office. I will be paying for that education for the rest of my life.
    
    I make far far less than the average pastor or person with my same qualifications. I have a master’s degree.
    
    My churches cannot afford to pay me what our denomination urges they pay.
    
    At the same time I am unable to take on additional work due to the time I spend doing pastoral care, planning and adminstation, area meetings and visits, hospital visits, classes, teaching, etc. No one would hire me since I could probably work 1 day a week.
    
    My churches aren’t in a position to pay anyone else to do some of the stuff I do, and the members, who also work and have families, cannot devote the time to volunteering regularly at the church. I can get a little out of them but it’s limited.
    
    Your view that pastors shouldn’t ask for the financial support they need but instead take on a part time job…what you’re really doing is turning a very difficult and costly vocation into a guilt trip against pastors who honestly try to do the right thing for their churches and their families.
    
    Show some compassion and understanding. The real issue here isn’t pastors and their greed or whatever but it’s churches that hire pastors without the financial stability to support them. How does one deal with this reality without putting undue stress on the pastor or family and without causing grief in the congregation?
    
    Figure that out and you can write a book

    Well said… The church today has feared the LORD, but served their gods. They have left up the high places of their fathers before them. They church has NO CLUE as to the biblical spirit of the letter of the law by which the Apostle Paul charged all the churches to learn by his example. They are literalists, letter of the law keepers when it suits the best and live life as pharisees. Christ said we would suffer Paul said to labor and as far as tribute is concerned we are held victims to our translators or those who want to interpret the scripture as it makes them comfortable. The church was never supposed to have one man doing any and all. It was the role or duties of ALL THE ELDERS in the body to do what? Ah… There you have it! We are to esteem these elders two fold that we do, those who do not teach. So if the scripture reference in 1 Timothy 5:17 is about finances then the whole church is bankrupt. But if it is about esteem or just honor, then this is an easy burden for us all to carry out. Shame on us who think it is about paying someone for a service that should be done freely as referenced in Matt. 10:8 But no one like to takes Jesus words seriously, they are most times taken as wonderful options. Father help these professing Christians!

        Charlie, Good questions and concerns about your Pastor who has a second job that has him running from church to the second job. I am a Pastor and I have a few thoughts. First, your Pastors job is to lead worship and proclaim the Gospel. That is a basic expectation of every pastor. So if a second job is interfering with that then you as a congregation need to put a stop to that and communicate the expectations clearly with your Pastor. Second, you commented on the fact that your pastor is “well paid”. I would encourage you, if you already haven’t, to make sure your measuring pay based on a universal scale and not just what might “seem good” or “like a lot” to your congregation. Finally, the pulpit is a place ONLY for the proclamation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Never, ever to fulfill an agenda of any kind. Your congregation might also want to hold your pastor accountable to that standard. Hope these thoughts help.

        You should get yourself another pastor. Better yet, pray together about members of the church entering into the offices, perhaps share the expenses for training.

        Dear Zack,
        I do agree with what you said but you stated false information, Paul didnt accept any funds except from the Philippians. He was infact a tent maker and that is how he raised his funds. He did however say it is not wrong to pay ministers. Because they have a right to be payed.

        In the book of Acts 18:1-4 Paul was making tent at the time preaching the gospel. In 2 Cor 12:13-21 He said ‘ I do not want to be a burdensome to the church to hinders the gospel!!!!

            I am a member at a medium size church 120 people on average probably. My pastor provides free counseling, parenting support groups, is a part of food pantry, serving free meals to over 100 people (members and non-members) every Monday, helps with the community center, helps get free bread for people every day of the week, participates in school board meetings in the community, attends trainings, has a Master’s degree, goes to the hospital anytime someone is in there, etc. This makes him give approx 55 hours a week of his time and you want him to work for free? This does not include the extra time he spends at home reading the bible and having people over for dinners, etc. I want my pastor to live well. I do not want him to be a CEO and make 3 million a year in base salary and 100 million in stocks and bonds, but he should not have to worry about providing for his family. I want my pastor to be able to provide everything I stated above with good mental, physical, and spiritual health. I work 60 hours a week and I am in grad school as is my wife. We cannot meet every demand and have to pick and choose what to put the most energy into during the day. We had to sacrifice our mental, physical, and spiritual well-being for many years to accomplish what we have. I am thankful that my pastor does not have another job because when my wife and I had issues 4 years ago he came over at the moment I called him at 10pm to provide some marriage counseling and then continued to do so until my wife and I worked things out. If he was working that night or could not provide these services to us for free then we might not be together today. People need to quit thinking about “me” all the time and think about how paying your pastor a decent wage can allow him to put all of his effort into providing the best spiritual guidance possible. I could go on forever why this argument about pastor not being paid is not only selfish, but it is also unbiblical.

            So are you saying that there wouldn’t have been ANOTHER member of the church, perhaps another Pastor who could have also talked you and your wife through your maritial struggles? Also, if the pastor had a regular 9 to 5, wouldn’t he have still been able to come over to your house at 10pm? Are you telling me that if he had not come over to your house right then and there at 10pm that night, your marriage would have ended and there would have been nothing he could do to help you at a later time if he wasn’t available at that very moment? Also, if your pastor was over a church of 1,000, even if the church was paying him a hefty salary where he didn’t have to work, do you think he would have been readily AVAILABLE to help you at that moment? What do you think people who go to churches where a pastor had several hundred members and simply CANNOT handle their issues immediately do? They go to another Christian who is well versed in the Word and experienced in martial issues. See again you’re relying on the assumption that a senior pastor is the only Christian who is able to counsel or help in your time of need.

            Sadly, there is so much greed and corruption within the church today. Some leaders even prey on many who are barely getting by such as those on disability. Every Pastor I’ve ever met has lived in affluent neighborhoods, driving nice cars, and wearing silk suits. The plate never takes a break in many churches I’ve visited yet even Jesus’ “Lord Supper” is only observed quarterly. Why? too timely? Many of it’s Leaders, are leading in the name of profit. Many deceiving many into believing “give” and you shall be blessed, yet under the guise of pure manipulation and impure motive and selfish desires. Long story short, I had one Pastor guilt me into giving only to have my washing machine go on the fritz the very next week. He came to my house, but it wasn’t to counsel (more poor motive). He panned out the water for me bc I feared it would leak down to the apt below mine. Up three flights of stairs, during the winter, physically and emotionally challenged (undergoing chemo/abandoned by family and fiance), This Pastor did not even take time to pray with me bf leaving my apt. Made no mention of how I was to figure out during illness how I would get wet laundry up 2 flights of stairs. The Elder that accompanied Him made a comment “is there some way we can help her”?…Pastor Mark brushed off the question and out the door they went. My point is two fold…1) When I gave $100 dollars to the Church, I gave anonymously. 2) When considering how I had been treated, I didn’t regret giving but I did feel sad for yearning to belonging. I felt no real belonging, I felt used.. I realized how much of an “undesire-able” I was in their eyes…how one might be despised if they were less then successful, despite what is given as an offering. The way they saw my illness was punishment. I don’t believe that is the way Jesus see’s me. So many false teachers teaching this “prosperity message, word of faith, name it claim it”..garbage, that now we have so many desiring to live and be accommodated to such an extravagance way of life. Not Jesus and the Boys, Why you might ask? I will leave that to you to determine for yourselves.. There is much going wrong in the Church today. I strongly feel if we take away the money aspect of it, it defuses the power everyone seems to find to be so attractive. Jesus did not take payment for the gospel and no matter how many want to distort that truth through multiple interpretations, in my book, it just reinforces the fact that money is their motive…and not Love as it ought to be.

        They had jobs. How do you think they made a living. Jesus was a carpenter by trade. They fished. They were fishing when the waters became rough. Jesus helped them catch fish in one verse. some were tent makers.
        
        Here is my concern. We asked our pastor to write down what he did each week and he replied with a list of items. It looked like 80% of his day was taken up with things not church related. community, personal interest and so on. He said that all these items are part of Gods work in some way and so we should not question his motives. I don’t want to question him but I am responsible as a trustee to the congregation to see to it that the pastor is working for the interest of those he serves. Also spending money on working lunches without a clear explanation for need. I don’t want to cause problems but It doesn’t seem fair to these good folks that have little but give much. Do you think I am being too picky? Is it reasonable to ask for a full disclosure of his time and written explain of these lunches and dinners. Should he spend more time at the church and less time else-ware. He asked for a sabbatical this summer and was turned down by a unanimous decision. He became very upset. As a result one of our trustees resigned from her position because of guilt. This all makes me question how independent churches are run. I have often said that you can have church in the woods. with no need of fiduciary responsibility. but when the congregation takes out large loans for a building making trustees responsible, it only makes sense to be completely forthcoming in all matters of business. Don’t make people guess. Don’t make people struggle to ask for accountability. That’s what causes problems. Help me understand where I’m wrong. I really want to do the right thing.

            If you’re working for the Kingdom, then you shouldn’t complain about money. If you can’t handle the workload, DELEGATE it to someone else. That is what they’re supposed to be doing anyway. Pastor’s work BEYOND their title and other people are being under utilized that is why he/she is over worked.

            You are “working” for God when you contribute to society in any positive way be it surgeon or sanitation worker. In that respect a pastor is no different than any other human being striving to use their God given gift to make a positive impact on the world in which we live. It is not what we do that determines if we are working for God it is how we do it – are we moving through our day in a way that reflects the values taught by Jesus. I am confused by those who would rather see a pastor hold a second job to provide for his financial needs than be fully focused on helping others come to a true understanding of Christ and what he lived and died for. There is no piety in poverty and a good pastor should be free from financial worry as should anyone who works hard to contribute. I guess at the end of the day I would rather see an honest pastor living in the lap of luxury than watching those that do nothing to contribute to the spiritual well being of our world do so. (maybe we would see more young people look up to their pastor rather than the poorly behaved, highly paid reality TV star of the moment)

    I’m curious, where does Matthew 10:8 speak of pay and compensation for Pastoring? The verse talks about healing and raising the dead and casting out demons, God speaks of nothing concerning the regular duties of Pastoring i.e. Preaching, counseling etc.

        Hello Brenda,
        
        A distinction in the ‘church’ today that is prevalent is this idea that there is the laity and the clergy. However, this distinction appears no where in scripture or early church life and only polarizes Christians. A church would do well to have everyone understand that when they meet together in the church, it is for the edification of all by all. This will not happen when distinctions like ‘laity’ and ‘clergy’ exist.

    I am amazed and astounded that so many of you Christians are so misinformed and cheap and uneducated about Gods worth about tithing. You all act as if the money you earn is your money when in fact, everything that you have is from God and belongs to God. To not pay a pastor is beyond belief and complete foolishness. If any member of my church made that comment to me I would recommend that they find another church. People who expect to have the pastor work for free probably know very little about tithing and generous giving. You, when you die, hopefully have the opportunity to kneel before Jesus and then you will have to explain why you squandered and buried your 1 talent in the field. I am not a pastor. I am a self employed business man and I have also worked in the corporate world for 23 years. I am a deacon of our church and I am on the financial committee. Rick Warren, who is a pastor, tithes 90% of his income to the church? How much do you tithe? Remember, its not your money, its Gods money. I am praying that God softens those who’s hearts have been hardened about what it means to give generously.

    I believe you are taking these scripture verses out of context. Others have been quoted that contradict what you are saying. Many pastors DO work a secular job because they aren’t compensated enough to support their families and it only serves to take them away from their families. Show me one place in the Bible that specifically shows a priest not being compensated in some way, according to God, for the work God ordains them to do.

    Fine. Next time one of your family members is sick and in the hospital and you want someone to visit at the drop of a hat at any time of the day or night, you call one of those people. Or you need someone to perform a funeral. Or to counsel you through a crisis. Or to do the hundreds of tasks that require PROFESSIONAL TRAINING!!! See how that works out for you and your “volunteer pastor.” You have no idea how many hours your pastor puts in, because most of it is done quietly, confidentially, and behind the scenes.
    
    Another point: Are we all not called to live our lives and do our jobs for the Kingdom of God? By your logic, none of us should be paid. So enjoy life on the commune.

    I am simply astonished at the number of comments on this post which suggest that pastors should not be paid or that argue one way or another entirely on the basis of pragmatic arguments.
    
    Jesus, through the Apostle Paul, commanded that pastors be paid – in fact that they should “get their living”:
    
    “Do you not know that those who are employed in the temple service get their food from the temple, and those who serve at the altar share in the sacrificial offerings? In the same way, the Lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living by the gospel (1 Corinthians 9:13-14 ESV).”
    
    Failure to do what the LORD commands doesn’t simply reflect a different point of view – it is crass disobedience to Christ’s command. The only appropriate response for those arguing against what the LORD commands is repentance.

    You can’t compare Jesus’ three year trek or Paul’s starting Christian churches throughout various regions of the middle east and africa to the duties of a LOCAL pastor. They HAD to give up their secular because they were traveling all over. Jesus’ mission was very unique in that he had to tell people why came to Earth before his crucifixion and Paul and the disciples had the arduous task of developing the worlds first Christian churches which involved extensive travel and sacrafice that goes far beyond what most local American pastors have to commit. The help that local pastors get today with air conditioned church buildings and staff would be considered a luxury back then. Besides a PASTOR is not the same as an APOSTLE. They have very different responsibilities. Since a pastor is sheparding a local group of Christians, there is no reason that he/she or their spouses can’t maintain a steady job, especially when they have able bodied church members who can pick up the slack and SHOULD be doing just that

    There lies the problem. The Pastor was NEVER intended to be the only person to go visit the sick, provide counseling, teach the youth, do administrative work, etc. I don’t NEED a pastor to visit me in the hospital if I’m sick. There are PLENTY of God fearing Christians like my mother and OTHER members from my church who can and WILL come visit me without expecting a DIME in return. It’s the LOVE OF GOD that is supposed to motivate us to do these things not some pay day! If you give me some advice as a spiritual confidant then get mad if I don’t pay you a salary, then I would prefer you give me no advice at all. There is someone else who loves the Lord who can encourage me with PURE intentions. I sure don’t ask my fellow bros and sisters in Christ to pay me every time they come with a problem.
    The truth is, no one man or woman can effectively Pastor several hundred people all at once. More than likely, if I’m in a jam, one of my family members or a particular church member that I may be friends with is more than likely gonna be there faster than any pastor would. Remember a Pastor was never intended to be the head of the church. In the New Testament, the title is listed as one of MANY that operate in the church. If a pastor wants to take on more than he can chew that is on HIM. He doesn’t have to.

    The common misconception seems to be that pastors only preach on Sunday. The fact is that pastors visit the sick, often take care of church business, actively study for preaching of the Word and teaching Bible study. Some even mow the church lawns and take care of maintenance. The more time and support the pastor has to do the work of the ministry without having to worry about their daily needs, the better.
    
    1 Corinthians 9:7,14
    Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard without eating any of its fruit? Or who tends a flock without getting some of the milk?
    In the same way, the Lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living by the gospel.
    
    1 Tim 5:18
    For the Scripture says, “You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain,” and, “The laborer deserves his wages.”

    Is that in the job description of a Pastor to do all that? Is there only supposed to be ONE person responsible for visiting the sick and shut in? NO! We are ALL supposed to do that! It’s what the BODY of CHRIST is supposed to do. The problem is, Pastors don’t believe in allowing EVERYONE to utilize their giftings in church and think they can do EVERYTHING. The church was never structured to have ONE leader but MULTIPLE Elders, PastorS, Teachers, etc helping. Also, many Americans CHRISTIANS work well over 40 hours a week AND are called to ALSO labor in the church AS WELL but they get paid NOTHING for that labor so what is your point. The misconception here is that Pastors are the only ones who labor in the church and are responsible for everything when they are NOT. In fact, many PAstors don’t even participate in the more labouraous tasks like cooking meals for the homeless, cleaning the church building, watching kids during church service, etc that other members READILY participate in without getting paid a DIME. You’re not the only ones laboring for Christ Pastors!

    Pastors can make as much money as they want. I won’t judge them. Just don’t ask ME to pay for the life you want. Get a job just like everyone else.

    This has been a huge struggle for me. I have worked for a non-dom for 14 yrs after spending an equal amount or more in the secular world in a HR capacity dealing with salaries, benefits, corporate issues, etc. After hearing about “biblical world views”, the intrusiveness of the government onto the workings of the church and watching not only a body of believers but a senior pastor as well be negatively impacted by the influence of money, here are my conclusions: A pastor should never be the sole decision maker regarding finances of any kind. A compensation package includes a fair wage and a fair level of expense reimbursement. There is a huge difference between the needs and wants of an individual when talking about the tools of their profession. The primary responsibility of the church are the sheep not the shepard. When taking care of the shepard negatively impacts the ability of the church to care for the sheep something is grossly errant. Balance is vital.

    Right, Steve. We (congregants) are to be the means by which God provides for our pastors. We should see it as our privilege to do so.

        Was Jesus giving instructions specifically about teaching elders, or was Paul? Jesus and the disciples were a one-time deal. Paul was giving specific instructions about under-shepherds.

    The Messiah did not come as an impoverished peasant!!! Mary’s father was a priest and she was dedicated to temple service as the first born. When the visiting Kings gave gifts to the Infant there was enough gold to sustain them even after Joseph’s death.

        I agree. The pastors in my area all live lavishly. More lavishly than the people I know working 60 hours a week. I personally know some of them and it is not a 24/7 job.

        I feel like I’m coming in the middle of a conversation.. ![[./_resources/Five_Things_You_Should_Know_about_Pastors’_Salaries_-_ThomRainer.com.resources/icon_smile.gif]] We have a change of Pastors..The new pastor has stated his salary will by $$. Since that (sermon) that is all that is talked about at Sunday service.. Unfortunately, at this time he is not the caliber of our last pastor. Her salary (well earned) could be seen in her work ethnic. Visiting the sick, taking care of the poor, mission work in Mexico and extremely busy with church programs…most of which were targeted at raising money. I believe the new pastor see the old programs and feels that “the work has been done” when in reality the work has just began. Our church is dying!

        He should support his family for certain. What is far less certain is that able bodied men should depend on the local church to pay them a permanent salary and benefits. We so often hear Paul quoted in 1 Cor 9 but it is pretty obvious that his focus was on not getting paid because that was an obstacle to the Gospel. Also worth noting, Paul was not a full time clerical employee for a particular local church but a itinerant preacher/missionary. We have taken a completely different situation and applied it to professional clergy when there is little to support that claim.

            If all believers’ paths are directing by God, if He has “called” you to be a lawyer, banker, teacher, etc; should you then be willing to work that position for free? I have been fulltime in a church for free and for compensation. My wife has never been compensated though many think she should be just as available as me. To obey is better than sacrifice, the question may be, “What has God called you to do, and what level of faith and grace has He directed you to exercise to accomplish His calling?” Many professionals take less paying jobs to “serve” the community in obedience to God or to reserve the necessary time to “ministry” God has called them to. Great conversation!

            How many times have u worked for free in your life? many people think that pastoring is just a TITLE and of which it is one of the most demanding and even difficult job. The Bible clearly states that a workman is worthy of his labour it is only in the Church that I see people trying to ague salaries especially pastor’s salary. I am not a pastor but this is very unfair and selfish it should not even be a discussion if pastors should not be paid then no other Job on earth is even also worthy of payment. If you don’t think pastors should be paid then try and be one yourself and taste how it feels!

        Desi,
        
        I sure think it would be fun to get to live there… even if it was just for a weekend.
        
        You missed my point. I am a pastor, I receive a salary. While I could understand someone feeling pity for my family, that would probably have more to do with my personality than how I deal with finances. ![[./_resources/Five_Things_You_Should_Know_about_Pastors’_Salaries_-_ThomRainer.com.resources/icon_smile.gif]]
        
        My point was that this is an issue of the heart. Im not sure how people missed that when I said, “Our desire, like Pauls, should be to be able to work for free despite having the right to be paid.” People, including yourself, responded as if I said, “Pastors should never receive money from the church, even if that means their family suffers horribly and is on the brink of death!”
        
        I hope your family has a great Christmas.

        You completely misunderstood the gentleman’s post. If you are going to disagree with a statement, atleast characterize it properly. I had to read his post carefully a couple of times before I understood what he was saying. Read with a level head and at least ask questions before you come to an oversimplified conclusion about someone’s statement. Speaking of condescending:
        “What’s it like to live in neverneverland…etc!!”?? C’mon… I think you’re better than that.

        The bible made us understand that if a man can not provide for his household he is worse than an infidel. Should a pastor be considered an infidel? Men of God are men before they were men of God, they are not spirits. They need money to cater for their immediate family needs. Remember he that works on the altar also live by that same altar.

        Whoa my friend, the church IS a business. Just ask the IRS. They look at churches as businesses and they look at the Pastors as the leading administrator, i.e., CEO. When interviewing for a pastoring position, the candidate has every right to insist on a livable wage to be reviewed every 90-120 days. If the pastor merits a raise, THEN GIVE IT TO HIM. How stingy we have become with God’s money in compensating God’s leaders in the local church. Shame on us!

            Dear Darren,
            
            As a pastor I fully agree with you that a pastor should not make “head and shoulders above the people who are sacrificially giving to the church.” From my experience, your church is actually an anomaly. Normally a pastor is paid meaningfully less than what other men of his age, education, and experience are making in the church where he serves. Of the churches that I know well, I cannot think of a single instance where the pastor has a higher salary than that of the Elders or Deacons in his church. This may be different in very large churches as I am mostly familiar with churches with less than 200 members.
            
            I suspect you live in a relatively poor part of the country, because in many parts of the country $85k per year is a comfortable, but not a particularly lavish, salary. Where I live, Assistant Principles make $10k+ per year more than that and they have a lot more time off per year than a typical pastor does.
            
            Often the issue of pastoral salaries is simply ignored in a local church. I would encourage you to talk with the Elders or Deacons in your congregation and ask them (with humility) to explain how they developed the budget and whether they have any benchmarks for how they are determining pastor’s salaries in light of community living standards.
            
            Let me add that trying to pay pastors based on need is a hopelessly tricky issue (unless your pastor tells you that he doesn’t need so much money). Financial need goes way beyond counting up the number of children a man has. If the church is able to do so, it is wiser to set pastoral compensation according to community standards.
            
            In Christ,
            
            David

            David,
            
            Thanks for your response. I have a couple observations that I would like to try to get feedback on: 1. Since becoming a Christian, I have been part of the PCA and SBC communities. The PCA in St. Louis area where we live is pretty much located in the more affluent areas and draws a lot of wealthy christians into their churches. The pastors that are part of the St. Louis area PCA are very well paid, but they are not making excessively more than their flock. Their flock is made up of CEOs, doctors, lawyers – basically white collar types. The PCA church where I attended in the early 2000s had their share of millionaires and even one couple who are on the Forbes 500 list. The senior pastor made around 150 K per year. The youth, associate and evagelism pastors made 50 K / year plus the church basically bought their houses for them. Plus they got some sweet benefits like having the church paying for their children’s tuition to private christian school K-12 and also pick up a big portion of their childrens’ college tuition at the denomination’s college – covenant college. (Many of these school benefits have since been cut).
            
            2\. When we moved South of St. Louis to a poorer area, we began going to an SBC church. The staff is definitely not paid as well. Like I said in previous post, the senior pastor makes a pretty decent living while the other pastors either struggle or their wives are forced to help with income. The senior pastor, in my opinion, makes too much because the average household that is supporting him makes significantly less than he does.
            
            It seems that churches are in competition with each other to attract ‘talent.’ The most talented preachers are drawn to the most affluent areas. The PCA pastors were definitely several calibers better communicators and likely more advanced in their theological understanding than the pastors in the less affluent area.
            
            In my opinion, this is how capitalism has effected the church. Churches are in direct competition with each other to land the best senior pastor. And to land the talent, a church has to pay. In the case of the SBC church I mentioned, they pay the senior pastor more than double the other pastors. And they even had to agree to pay him to the point that he is likely in the top 1% of wage earners in his congregation. Probably if they didn’t pay him this amount, the pastor would likely feel the Lord’s calling elsewhere. And I suppose that the SBC church then hopes that their talent will influence church growth.
            
            I think that capitalism (and I believe in capitalism as a economic driving force) drives our churches much more than we want to admit. I would guess that salary and benefits are a big factor in a pastor’s ‘calling.’

            Darren,
            
            You are undoubtedly correct that there is a type of capitalism at work in terms of affluent churches calling pastors from smaller or poorer congregations. As one of my professors used to say: “I’ve noticed that when the LORD ‘leads” a pastor to move to another church it is usually to a church that pays better.” It is hard to see how this model fits with God’s word.
            
            One idea that I have run by Elders and Pastors is that we should establish a flat salary for all pastors in our denomination and make adjustments only for housing allowances. If the purpose of pastoral compensation is to relieve the ministry “from all worldly cares” then this amount doesn’t change based upon whether he is serving a small or a large congregation or whether he is the youth or senior pastor. Affluent churches would therefore need to subsidize the compensation pastors are receiving at poorer or smaller congregations. I confess that this may not be a very good idea because literally nobody has ever agreed with my suggestion. On the other hand, I mostly hear people complaining about the current situation without offering any alternatives.
            
            Let me add one point in defense of pastors: When a young man comes out of seminary seeking a call he is routinely confronted by churches who are looking for “someone with an M.Div and 5 years experience.” When such a man goes to a small church that can’t afford to pay him a livable wage and then moves on to a better paying call five years later we should remember that this young man didn’t create the system – we did (by “we” I mean middle age Christians like myself).
            
            If we are not willing to change the current system we shouldn’t expect different results.
            
            In Christ,
            
            David

            David,
            
            I like your idea. A seminary friend of mine who felt called to be a pastor in a small town actually shared that idea with me several years ago too. He actually got a call from a church in a town with a population of about 2000 people shortly after he graduated. I lost track of him for awhile and then found out through the internet that he was no longer serving in the church in the town. He had moved to a pastorate in a much larger city. I figure he started a family and couldn’t provide for their needs in the smaller church.
            
            What a wonderful thing that the church could do in fulfilling the great commission and reaching rural people if the church body subsidized pastors in areas that can not support their pastor.
            
            It is hard to judge a pastor for taking a more lucrative position though. Most lay christians make job choices largely based on compensation. It just sort of feels wrong when we see our spiritual leaders doing that too. Also, I think I heard that John Piper, Baptist pastor in Minnesota, does not take a salary from his church’s sacrificial giving. I think that he makes money on sale of books and speaking engagements – not that every pastor has that luxury, but it does say something for a man that does not take every dollar that they can.

            well,in the old days I believe,those who were pastors..had a different view on being Christ’s representative….they actually were serving the Lord first ,over their own desires/comforts..I grew up in a country type SBC and I know salary was never the main issue for my pastors back them..and these men worked harder and under more terrible hardship than pastors today..I believe, ,a pastor should be paid for his dedicated, unselfish work in God’s service and to the church members and community where he ministers on a day to day basis.. and is following the example of Paul and the early apostles / disciples..doing the Lord’s work , having faith in Him to provide… this kind of faith always works for everyone !.No one should get paid just for holding a religious title! ..But,I know some pastors today that will bleed a small poor church dry and never do anything but visit the sick and maybe help out in a program they believe will bring them a pat on the back from big-hearted givers..at 76 years old and being a church worker for 40 years ,I learned just because a man(or women)goes by the title of minister does not mean they all have the “church groups” best interest at heart and sometimes their over- all behavior reveals they are not born again believers !!!I know one “preacher”that is just buying time until he can retire and is being paid over half of what this little church takes in, mostly from retirees in Fl…I know God would never approve of this kind of greed and will never bless the mess..sadly today,it is plain to see,many churches are working more under the “world’s” view than under the leadership of the Holy Spirit : (

            Ok…The Bible says that the pastor is to be counted worthy of Double Honor but since you so strongly disagree and think a pastor should only make what the congregation is making then lets make that fair and apply scripture concerning the early Church, In the early church EVERY MEMBER sold every thing that they had and redistributed everything among them selves…Do you own a car? Do you own a house? Have you sold all that you own so that everyone in the church is treated fair and equal? Do you require that a doctor who has sacrificed years of his life to go to school and treat peoples physical needs be required, in your church, to give up a substantial part of his pay check so that you can feel like everything is fair in the church? Our Churches are dying today because people will not allow the pastor to be taken care of and because people tell the widow of Zeraphath to not give to the man of God and therefor she is not being blessed, Show me the scriptures that say that you should limit the man of God and cut his salary down? Where?

            Darren, Julie, and others
            
            Thanks for sharing your thoughts and experiences. Most churches don’t know what their staff makes. Seems we are following the American business model, instead of imitating Jesus as he led his disciples. I have seen a senior pastor request raises to the point the church could not afford a youth pastor, and eventually membership started shrinking. I have also seen strong deacon or elder boards drive pastors to exhaustion. And one created a church split by telling the sr pastor he had to allow a board member’s wife to be on staff. Another pastor I know agreed to a salary, then wrote checks to pay for his mortgage and car payments…which was never reviewed by the board or finance committee. So I believe in meeting the needs of those who are chosen to do full-time ministerial work, but with accountability. Too often no one wants to bother with simple checks and balances.

            Dear AskBob,
            
            One of the amazing things about this article has been the variety of shocking practices it speaks to. I am a pastor of a local church and here are a few suggestions that every church should follow:
            
            1\. The pastor’s entire compensation package should be transparently communicated to the congregation.
            2\. The pastor should not be on the compensation committee of the church.
            3\. The pastor should not be the Treasurer nor should anyone related to the pastor be able to write checks. This isn’t because pastors aren’t trustworthy but has to do with the appearance of impropriety.
            
            One suggestion that nobody seems to want to follow would be to index the pastor’s salary to a publicly available compensation package. So instead of saying: “We pay our pastor X amount of money” the church could say: “We pay our pastor like an Assistant Principle of our local High School.
            
            I can’t imagine a (good reason) why any church would refuse to do these three things.
            
            Best wishes,
            
            David

        I agree that a pastor should never be in the job for the money, but I disagree that it is just not reasonable to expect them to live for free. This is not the era in which they can be self-sufficient farmers or something like in Biblical times. I do not think I would want to see a pastor working a 9 to 5 job 40 hours a week and then trying to maintain the church, as well. That would be unfair to ask of them. People need them at times like at the bedside while a loved one is passing away. How can they give their congregation their all if they are expected to do both. It is only right that they are supported by the congregation so that they can in return be the support the congregation expects of them. Please google Maslow’s heirarchy of needs to understand exactly why it is that we need to have pastors supported. The pyramid shows the order in which needs have to be met to reach the next level up.You will see, at the very bottom is the requirement to be able to do this, and basic physiological needs must be met first, like shelter, safety, food, water, before a person can even consider emotional needs and then having a purpose in life and giving back to others. At the very top is the “self-actualization” category, which means having reached the point in life where one feels like they are completing the duties in life they are meant to acheive, and have given back to society in a way they had anticipated to do so, ect. The person has to have all the layers to be able to reach a level to which they can be there for others. Hence, all these levels must be supported in order for a pastor to fufill the duties of a pastor. This is why we need to support our pastors financially, to allow for their physiological needs to be met so that they can accomplish fufilling our needs.

            I grew up in a blue collar family and have held blue collar jobs. I have known of blue collar people who actually took joy in giving the pastor a hard time because they viewed him as management. They actually kept a scorecard. The blue collar people 2, the pastor 0. Their two victories were tallied based off of two pastors dying of a heart attack while serving in office. I do not write this to say that blue collar people are bad. My father is one. My point is that we can both play this game of pointing to horrible examples of the other side in order to make our point. That being said, I do think a good portion of pastors would do themselves and their people a great service if they spent some time in the non Church work force for an extended period of time. Sometimes pastors do think like CEO’s or management. In some ways we must do that in order to efficiently run the church, but I do not EVER want to get to the place where I am so calculating that I am willing to ask someone to work day in and day out for free while paying for an evangelist.
            By the way, I know of pastors and blue collar folks who went to the office for 70 ours a week and only actually worked about 25 hours per week, and I suspect that it wouldn’t take you very long to think of some examples like that as well.

            But that’s the problem Dan, A pastor is not supposed to RUN the church. WE are the church, and we come together in a church service to worship God and edify EACH OTHER. Pastors need to stay in their lane and stop trying to ‘rule’ everything which the Bible clearly teaches church leaders NOT to do.

        Please explain. What does ‘full time’ ministry mean? The last time I checked ALL Christians are required to be on ‘full time’ ministry whether they’re on the job or at the church. In fact, ministry occurs most often OUTSIDE the church walls. You can minister to people anywhere you go. Besides, I’m pretty sure the praise and worship leader, Elders, and prayer team get tired when they come home from work and someone is calling them in for requests. You’re not the only one working in the church you know.

    I don’t believe that pastors should have to live in extreme poverty, but I do feel that some pastors, particularly in some of the mega churches are getting lavish salaries (more than I will ever see). I myself know what it is like to have to struggle, and I thank God that I am now back on my feet, If pastors should get a salary, it shouldn’t be much above I guess what they call poverty line income where you are earning above that. I realize that a lot of pastors have families, but they should be able and willing to make some sacrifices like making their children understand that they need to share certain things, and that some things will be handed down when the older child outgrows it. In the end the question that ought to be asked is “If a pastor should not be expected to live in poverty, then why should any of the members of the church be expected to if they are expected to pay a tithe every week?” I doubt that in any church that members of a congregation know what the other members go through in their everyday life, or what they have to do without. I imagine that some might know, but it at times comes from prodding and poking “your” nose in other people’s business. Don’t assume that every member in a church is financially secure or can afford to make constant sacrifices.

        Dear Ken,
        
        From your comments you seem unhappy with the fact that you are making less than the custodians, but you are communicating to the church that you are doing fine financially. I would encourage you to be more straightforward in communicating with whoever is responsible for the budget of your church.
        
        If things are fine, then there is no reason to complain on a blog. If things aren’t fine, then you ought to speak up.
        
        Best wishes,

        I am sorry for this church’s secretary. My husband has seen first hand what a wonderful secretary can do for a church and how a poor secretary can kill a church. He never misses and opportunity to praise his secretary both privately and publicly, including advocating for her salary. A good church secretary is worth his/her weight in gold, and we are thankful every day that we have one of these now.

    So Jason, you’re telling me that you would rather cut back on ministries than give up the two staff members you’re trying to provide salaries and pay packages for? Isn’t the purpose of a church gathering to fellowship, edify, and minister to each other? You may need to re adjust your priorities.

    It is possible that those verses are taken out of context. What is the main thrust of Paul’s argument here? Is it about compensation? Listen to the following verses,
    
    “Yet I have never used any of these rights. And I am not writing this to suggest that I want to start now. In fact, I would rather die than lose my right to boast about preaching without charge. 16 Yet preaching the Good News is not something I can boast about. I am compelled by God to do it. How terrible for me if I didn’t preach the Good News! 17 If I were doing this on my own initiative, I would deserve payment. But I have no choice, for God has given me this sacred trust. 18 What then is my pay? It is the opportunity to preach the Good News without charging anyone. That’s why I never demand my rights when I preach the Good News.”
    
    I think more is going on than a simple argument for pastors making their income through the church. I believe that Scripture’s truths should be applied universally, that is, they are true all the time, if they are in fact true. With this in mind, we are speaking about Pastor’s compensation within the context of Western America. Can these verses be reasonably applied to most other culture’s that are different from the American church model?
    
    I don’t think there is a “default” form of income for people in ministry. The examples in the New Testament are way to diverse to pin it down to that.

    Thank you, Dr. Rainer, I don’t want to bring shame to them, but being our first post-Seminary position their idea almost had merit. As painful as it was, we decided the best course of action was for me to take a part time job to supplement his income. 2 of our boys are now in middle school and are responsible enough to help out around the house and with their younger brother.
    
    Anyway, thank you again, I just wanted to make sure that my initial reactions weren’t selfishly and arrogantly motivated. I want to respond with care and compassion always.

        There was–as is always the case–much more going on than I was able to or needed to share. I was seriously considering going bi-vo, which is what I would have done if the Lord had not chosen to move us. In the end, it all worked out for the best.
        
        My simple point is that (a) they never should have considered my wife’s income when developing a pay package for me and that (b) the comments regarding our decision for her not to go back to work were hurtful and absolutely, positively uncalled for.

        Brother, I totally appreciate your situation. As a youth pastor, things worked out just fine for my wife and I before we had our first child. My wife became a stay at home mom, which is what we feel is best for our family and our goals as parents. I worked full time at the church and also worked part time. The extra work helped, but we were not able to afford medical insurance (which was very difficult since childbearing plays quite a number on a woman), and ultimately we were facing financial ruin if we stayed where we were at. I chose to find a new position because my church was either unwilling or unable (depends on which lay person you ask-but most of them have no real idea why I left) to give me the raise I requested. I have no hard feelings toward the church, I love them all dearly, but it was a painful decision to make and I totally understand the burden you felt. Ministry is not for the weak at heart.
        Blessings,
        DK

        Dear Dan,
        
        Your comment (“but most of them have no real idea why I left”) raises a question in my mind: Would the Church be better off if we spoke more openly about pastoral compensation. Before becoming a pastor I worked in the public and private sectors for 25 years. It was not at all uncommon for people to leave positions to earn more money elsewhere. Yet, we have made this topic something pastors dare not say. So, virtually no pastors ever acknowledge that one of the reasons they are going to another church is that they pay better.
        
        I recognize that this is a difficult subject to deal with, but when most of the congregation has no idea why a pastor is leaving how can we expect them to make appropriate changes?
        
        Best wishes,
        
        David

        David,
        Yeah, I agree, if I felt that I could have been more open about things I might have avoided having to leave. I went back to that church not too long ago for a youth conference. Some folks were glad to see me. Others are angry with me. They are angry, in part, I believe, because they have no idea what staying there would have meant to my family. They all loved my wife, my son and me, and I would like to believe that they would not have been comfortable with her enduring hardship (which she did) because we could not afford medical insurance. I also think that if they understood that we could not have any more children because we could not afford insurance that they would have understood. They would then not be angry with me, simply said that I had to leave. In that we could be unified.

        Dear BJC,
        
        Great questions! May I offer a few suggestions?
        
        1\. How much money a pastor’s wife makes should be irrelevant to the how much the church is paying its pastor. It would actually be illegal for a private employer to take a spouse’s income into account in determining the compensation it provides to an employee and I can hardly see how this is a good thing for a church to do. If the pastor and his wife want to donate much of his compensation back to the church that is the pastor’s decision and not one that the church should make on his behalf. If for some reason a pastor and church decide to lower his compensation because of his wife’s salary they should be prepared to immediately raise his salary and pay his health benefits if the pastor’s wife leaves her job for any reason. The extra cost of doing this should be included in the budget.
        
        2\. It is great when a pastor who is either already well off financially, or sure that he will be, chooses to take less money from the congregation (i.e. not receiving money for retirement). Yet, I still think that this is decision that a pastor should make and not one the church should impose on the pastor and his family. When I have counseled pastors in this situation I have encouraged them to take their salary and to just give it back to the church or to other ministries. The downside to the pastor taking less than a full salary is that it sets a false benchmark for pastoral compensation. You don’t want people grumbling over the next pastor because he is making thirty thousand dollars per year more than the previous pastor.
        
        3\. If a pastor has unusual financial needs, I would suggest that this should be handled by the Deacons like they would handle any other family in the congregation. This presupposes that the congregation is already compensating the pastor at the same level as people with similar education and work experience in the congregation are making. It is right that pastors face the same financial struggles (and the same support from the body of Christ) as anyone else in the church. On the other hand, if the pastor cannot pay for basic dental care for his son or daughter it would be a good opportunity to evaluate whether or not the pastor is being paid the same as other members of the congregation who have similar levels of education and work experience.
        
        I hope that is helpful.
        
        Best wishes,
        
        David

        How many ‘jobs’ do you know that rely on the labor of SEVERAL individuals to function yet only pays a FEW a salary, because they have a title. EXACTLY. Church is not a ‘job’. It’s a gathering for Christians to fellowship and edify and minister to each other, but here in America, people treat it like a way to make money. Considering the fact that church is a NON PROFIT that relies on donations AND volunteering from many of its members, if it is possible for a pastor not to burden other hard working members with a salary demand the church wants to make sure they have to pay as little out to individual members as possible and that includes taking the pastor’s spouses job into consideration if it is already sufficient enough to take care of the Pastor’s BASIC needs. THAT IS FAIR. I don’t want 90% of the church’s offering going towards a pastor’s rent while important ministries are being neglected. That’s NOT why I’m donating to the church. If you want to make more money, get ANOTHER job. Please

    Thank you for that. How many other jobs can a person have where they want to know what the spouse makes? For that matter, how many other jobs are there where the spouse in interviewed right along with the prospective employee? And if I decided not to attend my husband’s church, can you imagine the tongue-wagging that would ensue?

    Drop him. Besides, why is ONE person making all the decisions here? It doesn’t matter if he doesn’t want to delegate the work. If it needs to be delegated, the church needs to step in and do it anyway. The church was never intended for any one man to rule. Only CHRIST is the head.

    The tax situation is insane. How a pastor can be considered “self-employed” is beyond me. He or she is not grabbing a portion of the plate collection; he or she is completely dependent on the church for a paycheck. This is an archaic law that I can’t believe has not been successfully challenged.

    Thank yo sir for your article…well stated and well needed! Having been a bi-vocational pastor myself, I know all too well the weight that financial burdens can add to the pastor’s heart and mind as he endeavors to fulfill the call of God on his life. I’m afraid that many of the pastors who deserve the most financial help are the least likely to bring it up, because of the reasons you mentioned above. It is important for us to take care of God’s men while they are here with us, or we may find ourselves searching for a pastor one day who will care as much as the one who left, but will not be able to find one because of our unwillingness to bless the ones we’ve already been blessed by.

    To me, the question is not whether the pastor should be willing to work for free. (Personally I think that is hogwash and I find no support for that anywhere). The real question is what SHOULD the church do? How SHOULD they treat the pastor?
    
    SHAME ON a church that has a penurious attitude toward those who spend their careers leading them. They don’t deserve good leaders. The Golden Rule too often seems to have no place in the church, or so it seems to me.

        I agree with you we serve a God of order, planning and structure. Our God is into extremely detail. I agree that the organism must multiply but that happens through the regimented structure he put in place. Form the tabernacle other 3 groups with in the levites who had specific duties and task when they tried to get out of order they got swallowed by the earth. Number 16:1. Proverb 16:1 amplified says planning an organization is man job!

        Thank you for your post. “Supplies all our needs” how refreshing to read this from a pastor. Serving in Ethiopia I am sure had something to do your attitude. It is hard to complain when you see how absolutely we are blessed in the USA pastor or not. The whole salary of the pastor vs the average income is “covetousness” pure and simple.

    You are so right…..package is the “killer”word. This is something close to my heart and I speak to it every opportunity the Lord gives.As director of missions I believe it is my responsibility to inform the church leadership of their responsibility to provide for their pastor and staff in a generous way and that the Lord will bless any church that demonstrates their love in a tangible way. The other side of the coin is we who are called should work hard and demonstrate good stewardship……………all for HIS glory.

    I am very proud of our church and the way the finance committee handles this issue. The church is not large enough to support a full-time pastor, particularly with benefits. Yet they have offered our family a salary increase every year we have been with them serving bi-vocationally. They recognize our sacrifice as well as the joy with which we serve and the small salary increase just shows us that they appreciate our ministry. I’m sure they could show appreciation in other ways as well but this sure means a lot, especially for our kids. Of course, being bi-vocational it is not as much of a “need” as it was when I was serving full-time. Those guys really need to be shown the love, especially in small churches. They sacrifice much for the kingdom but most don’t even see it as a sacrifice but a joyful service.

        The SBC is a Non-Biblical Machine. It has no, none, nada, zilch basis in the biblical principle of church life or organization. It is a business that should be guided by secular business principles. There is NO comparison between the employee of the SBC and that of a church pastor.

    Good thoughts Tom. I think that is the hardest part about applying for ministry positions is feeling you will be judged as more interested in money than ministry if we ask about salary or even cost of living raises in current positions. Many of us have to ask that question though because many of us have families to care for and support.
    
    I definitely relate with number one. It is almost deceptive to present a compensation package as a salary package when much of it is going to insurance, retirement etc. All good things, but not an accurate predictor of what the pastor is actually bring home to pay for bills, housing and food.

    Well written; I’ve been on both sides of the scenario over the years as a pastor. Something tells me a lot of Pastors might not “share” but will “like,” “favorite,” “retweet,” and whatever else they can do to non-nonchalantly expose people to what you said!

    I think it is truly sad to hear Christians who feel the need to burden those who give more of their heart and dedication to their churches than any ceo ever would for their company. Jesus’ ministry was supported by rich women who followed him around and paid for everything. How’s that for a Biblical model for compensation. Luke 8.

    Thank you for this. So true. I was forced out of my church recently because other churches helped us out financially over some major bills in our life because our church couldn’t pay us more. They took this as financial mismanagment on our part, yet we couldn’t afford to live on what they paid us.

    A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away…
    
    One December business meeting, the newly formed finance committee (unwittingly) stated something to this effect: “When you total everything up, it comes out to $\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.” They had lumped salary, housing allowance, retirement, health insurance, utilities on the parsonage, the fair rental value of the parsonage, and the mileage reimbursement into one figure. The congregation walked away thinking, “Our pastor makes $\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ a year.”
    
    For a couple of years after that, the vast majority of the people who were present in that business meeting still thought, “Our pastor makes $\_\_\_\_\_\_,” and they operated accordingly. In reality, the pastor made about 60% of the figure that had been stated… before taxes.
    
    Let’s just say the figure thrown out in that business meeting was $35,000. It wasn’t quite that high, but the math’s easier this way. Let’s also say his actual gross income was 60% of that, which sounds about right. The pastor was actually “making” $21,000 a year. Subtract from that health insurance, retirement, and, of course, taxes. What’s left? Not much.
    
    But everybody in the church thought he was making $35,000 a year.
    
    Does anyone else see a problem?

        Jeanine,
        Ok, let’s take my husband’s salary. He has a 4 year degree from an accredited University in music. Then he went to a Seminary, also accredited, for an additional 3-4 years for a Master’s Degree also in music and worship. He makes roughly $19.200 a year in gross salary. You are right that he doesn’t pay rent or utilities. We do pay our own health insurance at this time. So that is a household bill we do pay, add to the fact that we are never enough people to qualify for any kind of group rate. If we were to take out our denominational health insurance offering through Guidestone, which is amazing and we would love to do, it would be $700 per month for our family of 5. That would be 2 of his paychecks. So now we’re trying to operate on $700 a month “spending money” to pay gas, car insurance, car loans (possibly), children’s educational expenses, clothing and groceries.
        
        I just wanted you to see some real numbers on that spending money.

        I try to follow the letter of the law as it relates to paying taxes, and, from that perspective, would like to offer some clarification.
        
        While it is true that pastors live in parsonages “rent free,” pastors must, according to tax law, pay state income tax and the full Social Security tax on the Fair Rental Value of the parsonage, fully furnished.
        
        Pastors are also supposed to pay state income tax and the full Social Security tax on any utilities paid by the church on the pastor’s behalf.
        
        So, even though it’s “rent free,” it’s really not, because pastors must pay these taxes… out of their salaries, which are also taxed (tax on “salary” = federal income tax + state income tax + the full Social Security tax).

            I’m truly sorry if you took my comments as condescending in any way. They were not meant to belittle or condescend but to edify. We haven’t whined or complained to our congregation. We are grateful for the roof over our heads and the heat in the winter. The suggestion that I am ungrateful hurts me, and I believe that it hurts the kingdom of God as well. We’re all here trying to better ourselves and our ministries, or in my case, support my husband and God’s ministry through him. We need to find ways to be uplifting to one another or no one is going to see the Light through us. I will be, as I have been, praying about my attitude. Thank you for allowing me to see that my comments here could be hurtful to someone reading them. I will strive to do better from this moment forward.

                Neither comment sounded condescending to me. I serve a great church and am well-compensated, though I haven’t had a raise in several years. My problem is the constant tension between trusting God to meet the needs of my family and the equally Biblical mandate to provide for my family. When you figure out how to resolve that tension, please let me know.

        Absolutely, My years ago wife graduated from a christian college with a teaching degree and applied for a job at a christian school that was run by a church. My wife asked about pay and it was minimum wage and no Social Security contribution. My wife said, “I can’t live on that”. The pastor replied consider it ministry. Needless to say she didn’t take the job. Years ago, my cousin was on a board of deacons at a church that had a fairly large christian school at the time. The pastor and deacons were not afraid to go before the church to ask members to give “more” by faith for this project or that missionary etc. My cousin asked the board if they would be willing to give the teachers a one time bonus in the following year. Most objected and said the church couldn’t afford it. He countered and said why don’t you appropriated it by faith like you ask the church members to do whenever you present them with a “project” need. Well, they teachers got their bonus that one time the next year.

    \*\*To clarify, since my sentence order above may cause confusion, the Roman Catholic error that I am referring to is the following: We draw an unbiblical distinction between “church work” or so-called “full time Christian ministry” and the work everyone else does and therefore we want to treat these kinds of work differently in various ways.
    
    The following is NOT the Roman Catholic error, but is a sound, biblical idea about work: God is just as pleased in Christ with one Christian’s dedicated work for him as another’s, whether he is preaching a sermon or she is nursing a baby.
    
    Hope that clears things up.

    I salute the pastors (and their wives) who endure the financial hardship to stay in the ministry. I was full-time for nine years…have now returned to a full-time secular job and pastor part-time. It is not nearly as rewarding but it is necessary. One issue was health insurance which I desperately need….another issue was the pay. My predecessor often said, “The custodian makes more than I make.” And he was right on the mark. God bless all of you!

    Thanks for your post. As a youth minister I had to make the gut wrenching decision to leave a church that I loved due to financial issues. I have often wondered whether I had been carnal instead of spiritual, or selfish instead of unselfish. I know that I didn’t have selfish motives, but it hurts when you know people you love think you were just using them as a “stepping stone.” I also doubted myself because a mentor that I love and trust doubted me. Anyway, I still love those people but I still need reassurance from time to time because the experience still stings. Your post was timely. Thank you.

        Absolutely. It is more than okay, but it is actually justified. Your first order is to love Christ and serve Him faithfully. Then you love and serve your family faithfully. Then you love and serve your church faithfully. If another position comes open that God gives you direction on and it better allows you to support your family, then to stay simply because you’re fearful of perception is almost idolatrous.

    My husband and I are 37 year non denominated missionaries in Haiti. We were there for the quake, all the coup d’etats, hurricanes and disasters that never made the news. Every day we minister the gospel to 2,000,000 Haitians through our Creole Christian TV show that is aired on 100 stations from Boston to the farthest South and East border of Haiti. We have never received a salary, no one has ever asked us if we need one. We do not have a compensation package, our health ins and life ins is over $1000.00/month! We may have to discontinue both this year. Stress? We fast when the stress threatens to derail our lives and ministry. In six months in 2009 I didn’t eat for 82 days. It works God sent a miracle of provision. Leave the field b/c of pay issues? We’d sooner deny Christ. I wish someone would write an article about missionaries and what it means to leave family, friends, country and all the conveniences of the States w no pay!

        David, thanks for your reply. In our local area, most professionals with master’s degrees earn 40k annually. Our pastor, who only holds a B.S. degree earns 60k base salary alone. Our church size is largely irrelevant except to show that while people, and thus giving, has decreased, the salary has not. Your suggestion earlier to check military pay tables isn’t a bad idea. Checking federal tables for chaplaincy shows him to be overpaid (remember he’s not educationally qualified without an m.div.) and in the military he’s not far from par with a senior captain. So, thanks for your comments, but our current situation is different than you imagined.

    I didn’t read all 75 comments, but I’m wondering has anyone addressed the issue of “cost of living increase”? In a time when most workers are NOT receiving and increase, and in some cases are cut back, should a church automatically give an increase to the pastor and not other staff members? I did a little research and the “officially” calculated cost of living increase is the lowest it has been since 1975 or so….

    I appreciate this article, it was very beneficial as an associate minister. It saddens me that so many people think that ministers should simply do their job for free. Many will quote Paul and talking about bi-vocational ministry, But here is a little bit of truth about that, Jesus also says no man can serve two masters. Anyone that expects their minister to give full-time pay attention to the church and also work a full-time job is deceiving themselves. If you work a job outside of the church often it causes us to divide our attentions and our focus. Also when you see Moses establishing the priesthood the tribe of Levites was to receive their inheritance their living and their daily meals out of the offerings that were presented to the temple, A.k.a. the people of Israel were supposed to support their priests and leaders in ministry. I have been blessed to be employed in full-time ministry at a church that pays us fairly, but I do not do this position for the money because if I was working for the money, I would do something else! For all of those trying to get out of paying your pastors, please pay your pastor!

        David I love your example, let me add this thought. While housing allowance, and tax may be the same for clergy and military, your average soldier when he gets off duty can throw back a few beers, jeer at women, maybe get in abar room fight. Curse at subordinate soldiers (if your a sargent etc.) And the list goes on. Not one will lose his job for cheating on his wife. However the pastor can do none of this. We pay him not only for his life on the pulpit but mostly off the pulpit which is even more important. What’s the price tag for integrity

    Hi,
    
    Since I saw it come up several times throughout the conversation, I just thought I’d put it out there for those who may be interested…whether you are a pastor or on a board who makes decisions about paying the pastor…we have been members of a Christian Healthshare Network for over 8 years, and we absolutely love it. NEVER do we ever want to go back to “real” health insurance. We’ve had several needs over the years, all of which have been shared completely. Not only do we save tons of money as opposed to paying “real” health insurance premiums, we can choose our doctors and never have to worry about paying for things (through a premium) that we don’t agree with biblically. Plus, it is an incredible network of prayer and support. Love it, love it, love it. Samaritan Ministries. (Oh, by the way, we aren’t in paid ministry, but our church pays our pastor’s family share.)

            Dear David,
            
            Thank you for the help. I appreciate your insight.
            
            The reason for my concerns is that the pastor is the treasurer, and he was the one who took out the loan. The reason he gives is that several years ago, during tough economic times, there were not enough offerings coming into the church. Bills had to be paid, and there was not much left over to pay the pastor. The pastor took out the loan so that he could put food on the table.
            
            There were two elders who agreed to the loan. One died a year and a half ago. He was the pastor’s father in law, who resided with the pastor. The other is a man who does not know how to say no.
            
            There were two additional loans taken out, one for a lawnmower, and the other for a copy machine. Both of these loans are outstanding. I’ve been contacting Crown Financial Ministries, as well as Resource Ministries for their advice. I can find no where in Scripture where it is permissible to go into debt to purchase stuff.
            
            I am now in the process of working up a budget, as well as getting our church out of debt.
            
            Thanks for your help,
            
            David

    There is a pastor of a church who is well taken care of with salaries and benefits, considering the size of the church which is only about 250. But, the problem is, this pastor has some personal financial stewardship issues that puts him in a negative cash flow inspite of his generous salary. Now he applied to another church because they offered him a higher pay. Is this a right reason for a pastor to do?

    I found the formula for a pastors salary:
    Take the value of your marriage, family, peace, self worth, wisdom, comfort, courage, health, etc. Oh and let’s not forget your SOUL. then multiply it by the number of people in your church. When you come with the number. Then consider the Pastor is called to be the” WATCHMAN”FOR ALL OF IT. Hebrews 13:7
    All the promises of God are received by faith, faith come by hearing, HOW CAN THEY HEAR WITH OUT A PREACHER Romans10:14. ….pay the pastor

        David,
        Goodness. Lot of ire, wrongful speculation, and outright accusation in your reply there, pastor. Seeing you know nothing more than what you could glean from my posting, you sure didn’t have any trouble jumping to a lot of conclusions. But, having looked at other replies you’ve made in this forum, that’s not to be unexpected.
        There is no need for my going to the church leadership. The pastor is it and I’ve been to him on more than one occasion regarding his lack of participation in church ministries and his unwillingness to conduct more than one service a week. I also know he’s relayed to me what his week is comprised of, so your charge that I have no idea of what he does – or that I’m “just filling in the blanks with your own imagination,” – is incorrect. Again.
        I made no mention of this pastor’s salary being lavish or even VERY comfortable … if you re-read my previous comment, you’ll find you’ve again jumped to the wrong conclusions. Interesting.
        And you’ll also notice that my comment about his wife working had only to do with the extra income she brought into the household and nothing to do whether or not she should be doing that – or whether or not it was the congregation’s business. Again, you jump to a wrong conclusion. Seems to be a trend developing here, no?
        I’ll go back to my original posting … there are some pastors who do VERY little pastoral work and get paid well for the little they do. Nice work if you can get it. I will also add, there are some pastors who are so blinded by their own prejudices/biases that they can’t correctly render an accurate reading and assessment of a posting.

    Quick question about #1: What is health insurance?
    
    Raising 3 kids and a disabled wife on 31,200 a year. (While trying to pay for grad school).
    
    Had to move out of the parsonage to get my kids into a school where their life wasn’t n danger (long story). Started programing to pay for rent and other expenses.

    We are in the middle of packing to move away from a congregation that brought us here under false pretenses. They lied, plan and simple. Made us believe they could pay my pastor spouse a fair living. However, after we were here, we find out their history is to keep a pastor (underpaid) for three or four years and then drive him/her out because they’ve run out of money. Tired of being lied to by congregations.
    
    I’d like to know why our housing is added to his salary also. If there is a parsonage, which in my experience is always a rundown mess, we have to pay income taxes on the fair rental value. How can this be fair when we’re forced to live in THEIR house for THEIR convenience? What other job owns a person and his/her family, controlling every moment of their lives? Who in their right mind would put up with these conditions. I wish my pastor spouse would leave the ministry and all of it’s stress.

    An excellent post.
    
    Besides modest salaries, SEMINARY HAS BECOME INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE. When I got my MBA, my student load burden was about 2/3 of my expected annual income.
    
    My wife just graduated from seminary and got ordained. Her student loan burden is three times her expected annual income.

    Dr. Rainer,
    
    I appreciate the information in your blog. I wish that more church members would actually participate in reading and studying information about being a help to all of their ministerial staff. As a Worship Pastor for 30 years I have never felt “overpaid” by a church. On the contrary, I have often struggled to make ends meet. It seems as though church members are less educated and less involved in the budget process than at any other time in my life.
    
    The issue of salary versus cost of living (COL) increases has weighed heavily on me in the past few years. We live in a very high COL part of the country. Because of COL increases, I now earn less than when I started at my current church 7 years ago. Throughout my ministry we have made a personal choice to do without many things (TV, second car, vacations, new clothes, etc.) so that my wife can stay home with our children and homeschool them through high school, but that decision is becoming more and more difficult. And I am on staff at a church that runs almost 1000 on Sundays.
    
    What I make is up to God and his church, but I have to admit that I have struggled with the sin of envy often throughout my ministry: not only from what others outside of ministry have, but even from what Senior Pastors have. It has never been easy to see the Senior Pastor drive up in a new vehicle every few years when we have a 20 year old clunker, or to hear about his fishing boat and jet ski when we cannot even afford to visit the dentist but once every 5 years or so, or to listen as the Senior Pastor requests that the church increase the Cooperative Program giving from 20% to 21% because he doesn’t need a raise this year when I am considering leaving the church because I cannot afford to live in the area any longer.
    
    I hope that churches will take an honest look at the salaries of their associate pastors and support staff. Adding another position just because the church has grown is not always the wisest thing to do if the church cannot faithfully support their current staff financially. Creating an environment of stress among staff due to financial strains leads to unhealthy church staff relations and in turn an unhealthy church body.

    As a Pastor of a small church the members are on SS or retired and can’t afford to pay me and collections are rare since funds are not there so we are an unfunded church, I work full to keep a roof over my families head and food on the table with bills barely not always paid.
    
    I am what some have called a Bi-Vocational pastor because I am on call 24-7 (My work accepts this and is ok).
    What about those of su who get no pay and things needed are either donation or out of our pocket. I am part of an association with many pastors like I am mixed with others who get paid and you can always feel tention and see the divide when we all get together.

        Dear Paul,
        
        I am not a lawyer so I have nothing to say about legal issues.
        
        I am, however, a pastor and I find it appalling that any pastor would be trying to sell things to members of his congregation. Yikes! That is just horrible.
        
        Best wishes,

        Joseph,
        
        Don’t be a lone ranger. Go to the leadership of your church and talk with them about your inward sense of calling. Specifically ask for their evaluation of your gifts for ministry and for them to provide mentoring to you. They should provide you with some helpful feedback. Also, be candid with the leaders of your church about your financial situation.
        
        In Christ,

        My comment here is not advice for your current situation. Your situation doesn’t appear to be similar to the following person’s situation. I know a guy who was pressured by his pastor to attend seminary full-time. His had a good paying job. He told me that it was the pressure from his pastor that caused him to decide to attend seminary. The 2 years he spent attending seminary were difficult for him. He and his family barely got by. His wife went from a stay-at-home mom, to having to work outside the home to pay the bills and put food on their table. He was miserable. The stress from attending seminary, coupled with a mounting educational debt, made their lives unnecessarily difficult. Finally he started praying and seeking God’s guidance for his life and for the lives if his family. In the end, he made the decision to drop out of seminary, and went back to his previous vocation. The last time I talked with him, he told me he had his peace back and his family were much happier, too.
        Seminary isn’t for everyone. Seminary is basically for people who are looking for a career path. People from well-to-do families, and people who are well-off themselves, are good candidates for seminary. Otherwise, a person, if fortunate, will graduate seminary burdened with a huge debt. With such debt hanging over ones head, it makes it very difficult to minister effectively. I sometimes wonder if the burden of debt is what has caused some pastors to become crooks.

        That was an awfully curt response. there are many duties required of a pastor besides using their spiritual gifts. As i have said previously, dont pay the pastor for performing their pastoral duties, but pay them well for the myriad of duties they perform outside of using their spiritual gifts and the numerous hours of overtime they put in.

    Ive joined this conversation late, but want to say THANK YOU all of you that have dedicated your life to helping others see the kingdom of God.
    I pay my tithes faithfully and if you pastors go iout and buy a mansion I could care less. If it makes you happy please do it do when I see you Wednesday for Bible study and Sunday for some of the best lessons I’ll ever learn, I WANT you happy..
    I’ll even come clean it for you.. Just ask.. You teach me what God has taught you, giving tithes and offering is the least I can do.. Stephanie..
    “faithful till the end”

        Dear Ellen,
        
        While there is no exact compensation package called forth in Scripture, your assertion that pastors should not receive a full-time salary is simply not Biblical. For example, in 1 Corinthians 9:14 Paul writes: “In the same way, the Lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living by the gospel.” Two thoughts:
        
        1\. First, this passage unambiguously endorses pastors receiving full time salaries; and
        2\. Second, please note the strong language Paul uses. He doesn’t say that the Lord suggested but that the Lord commanded that those who preach the gospel should get their living by the gospel.
        
        Best wishes,
        
        David

    Awesome post. Korean churches are known to have this huge difference from senior pastor and associate pastors. Even in financially well established churches, while senior pastor is paid enough to make a living, most full-time associate pastors are paid part-time.
    
    I didn’t become a pastor to live an extravagant life and God’s grace is sufficient to barely get by, but I’m not sure where that balance is anymore. I’m not starving or anything, but I really don’t understand how our family lives every month with what I make at the church. Stress and pressure is definitely there, but I do see God’s provision in somehow making ends meet. However, it would be very nice to see and know that numbers do add up for the month and I don’t have to scavenge hunt. I’m constantly debating if I should find another job, or if I’m supposed to stick around and let God sort of do His thing like He had every month.

    I think we are missing the point the most important thing is the LOVE of GOD n the teaching of his word !! Should it matter who’s getting paid n who’s not ?? Who are we to judge ?? I personally believe pastors should get paid why not I. The Old Testament GOD always wanted the high priest n his family to get a part of the sacrifices..I am not a pastor and I wasn’t raised in a church but I love my Heavenly Father n I have given my life to him in JESUS name I hope I never get caught up in things like this I pray that my love n innocence will always remain !!! If there is a chance that a pastor is doing wrong with money or whatever they will be judged accordingly …. I give my tithe n my offering not to my church n not to a pastor but to the kingdom of my GOD what they choose to do with it that’s not my problem as long as I’ve givin with the right heart. And I’m glad my pastor doesn’t have another job and that we the church and the word of GOD is his one n only priority !! Stay blessed all of u xo !

        There is no such thing as a full or part time pastor. God has given ALL of us gifts and we are to use them WHENEVER we can. There are supposed to be multiple pastors in a church anyways because no one person can pastor hundreds of people effectively so there shouldn’t be any reason why one person is suffering a burn out.

        No need for the sarcasm. And we should have all things in common. Let all Christians get a 9 to 5 so as to not burden others for money and donate to those who are TRULY in need- children and widows. Not to those who are able bodied and able to work a regular job!

        Using your examples, Paul was a traveling evangelist with no spouse or kids, and made mention, several times, of other churches supporting his ministry while at churches that were unable or unwilling to do so. Also, Jesus laid down carpentry when He entered into full-time ministry, as did Peter, and Matthew, etc… Jesus’ full-time ministry was supported by those He ministered to enough so that he required a treasurer. And there was evidently enough petty cash in the treasurer’s charge that he was able to skim off the top and the ministry was not severely impacted. Is it safe to state that most churches require more of the average pastor than what the Bible lays out as so-called pastoral duties? I would say so. Many times if a person carries the title pastor, it is assumed by many congregations that pastor is Greek for indentured servant. while there are a FEW who lavishly abuse their position, that should not be leverage used to force the average pastor into indentured servitude. If you take issue with paying a pastor, I have a compromise for you. stop paying your pastor for being a pastor, but pay them well for the mountain of tasks they are responsible for on a daily basis that go waaaay outside the biblical model of pastoral duty.

    Thanks for your insight Dr. Rainer. I’m in a church plant that is about to eclipse 5 years. Budget decisions are only made by 3 pastors on the Elder Board (but we have 5 Elders) with no congregational input and little transparency. Pastor salaries are displayed as a line item instead of individually and the lead pastor is still soliciting about half of the budget from outside support. Out total budget last year was disclosed as $800K and we have a weekly attendance of about 300. Is this problematic? Should I be concerned about moral hazard here?

    I’m currently looking for a pastoral job in a southern baptist church. I will be getting my ThM in the Spring of 2014 from DTS. Is it too early to start apply for a pastoral job? How does the process looks like? I will be 30 years old. What should i expect in terms of pay and benefits? I married with no children. I’m currently looking in the State of Texas and Florida.

    There will always be those on church boards and governing bodies in churches that deep down believe that ministry is a service for the Kingdom of God rather than a paid vocation. While I believe that ministry is a service, if one is engaged in full time ministry, one has a right to be fairly compensated. Today’s church is a bit different than it was 50 years ago, even small rural churches are seeking seminary trained pastors, I can assure you, as a third year college student, even though I am 53 years old, college education is extremely expensive. By the time a complete my Masters studies, I will be on the hook for 80000.00 in student loans. So as I accept a pastor position, budgetary issues are a concern, i am certainly not in the ministry to get rich, my treasures are being stored up in heaven, as I am sure 90+percent of ministry leaders agree, I will however need to meet my modest lifestyle expenses and student loan repayment. it is not too much to ask that salary be enough to cover that. i guarantee, that anyone not involved with full time ministry has no clue of the time demands of the job, there is preparing sermons, counselling, marrying, burying and baptizing, visiting the elderly and shut ins, continuing education, special programs, missionary, and the list goes on. I know of no pastor that works less than a 50 hour week. just my two bits….

    Thank you for your posting. Two of your points really hit home, we have our parsonage and utilities come out of our pay which brings my actual pay down to working fast-food 30 hours a week. The second was your last point I almost feel like I am being pushed out because of money concerns. I love my Church and I try my best to love our little community of hermits but I see very little options left for my family except to make that cliche move to a Church in the suburbs.

    This post is awesome, a lot of great point of views. I never knew how much of a debate this was. This is why most pastors won’t preach this, because its so sensitive. I am not a pastor but I can say when you have pastors that give you the word of God like mine does, and you see the fruit of your tithes when our church can pay a policeman salary that was on the chopping board for layoff, 12000 ytd people fed, 3000 people clothed, transitional housing for people in need where WE pay their rent and utilities, 12 people who has had foreclosures cancelled, where blind eyes have been opened, the deaf can now hear, I myself am a living witness of eczema free for four years. Who cares about how much we give our pastor. They will never get what they deserve, I just pray that all of you word based pastors truly receive heaven here on earth and also receive a double portion. I give tithes, offering, building fund, and directly to my pastors and won’t loose any sleep about it. I will give generously on every occasion. And I’m not done receiving my harvests because I’m not done sowing…… Be blessed

        I would argue that pastors do contribute in ways that provide meaningful benefit to society – it’s just that many are able to do fine in life without the interaction of belonging to a church community. There’s also weddings and funerals where those wish to have them handled within the context of the church. If the pastors are doing their job, then they are teaching people about what is right and wrong and how to live in harmony and peace with other people. The problem today, is that too many people just want to go to church, feel good, and socialize – people don’t want to hear about sin, repentance, and how they should be working toward less self-centered materialistic living.

    We are all shepards of the lord and we must serve out of our hearts rather than seek financial compensation. Jesus did not draw a salary. In our selfish society we must do as Jesus did and live and love without expectation of reward.

    Do you have any information on Youth Pastors? I would like to know how many Youth Pastors are forced to work “other” jobs to care for their families. I beleive that like Pastors, Youth Pastors/Leaders struggle to focus on leading their youth groups becasue they are pulled in so many other directions (Family, Church, Work, etc…)

    Is it proper for a pastor’s sister-in-law to be on the chairperson or even a member on the church’s finance ministry. And what about his brother being on the finance ministry to sign checks. Where can I find information on these issues as they seem to be a conflict of interest?

    Many pastors find themselves performing the role of counsellor, which I don’t think should be in their job description unless they have formal education credentials in the counselling field. Of course, additional salary is most definitely needed for this type of work. Pastors frequently burn-out from the stresses and emotional toll of counselling, particularly in small churches where there are no other pastors on staff. I would suggest that counselling be done by a professional other than a pastor, whether in the context of a church or outside agency. To me, being counselled by a pastor and then attending the same church creates a feeling of awkardness – particularly when the issues being dealt with are of a highly personal nature.

        This kind of “A-typical” church administration is, fortunately, quickly becoming the norm of the past. Slowly but surely the attitude toward Sr. & Jr. pastors is changing simply because these pastors are changing. It’s not only the congregants who want more from their ministers, but the ministers themselves are desiring more from the Lord; a ministry similar to that of Jesus’ ministry. Finally. Once that begins to take place within the local church, we’ll see the attitude of ministers and congregants alike change for the better.

        You sound like a gem that our church would love to have. Our part-time Pastor gets $40,000. for 20 hours a week. He charges members $400 for funerals, advent and Lent services are extra also. We have around 55 a Sunday, most are over 65.His wife was friendly till He got established and a member now she is only there on Sunday, does nothing for or with the church women. We are having trouble making budget, having money for oil heating. I have a question, He works for us, can’t we ask and receive an accounting of how he spends our time?
        Many times you say a pastors pay…ours decides how his is broken down, housing $32,000, salary under $1,000, pension, He opted out of SS, and so on. So don’t say to me, how little we pay, he qualifies for food stamps. Many of us are worse off them Him.

        Very sorry about your experience, but you make my point. Many pastors treat others (paid or unpaid) like hirelings. I know of a pastor whose church hosts a large couples retreat every year. and every year at the end of the retreat an offering is taken for him and his wife. The truth is many people in his church contribute/volunteer hours upon hours to make this retreat possible and he walks away with the cash on top of what he is paid when he could put a stop to it and say enough is enough. It is embarrassing for people in his church. Now he has decided to put a man in the church (a wannabe pastor) over the retreat event so he has more time to speak as an evangelist in other churches (of course accepting a purse every time he preaches). I have learned over the years that pastors are their worst enemies. By the way this pastor is always talking about how giving he is. How that his family likes to give. A few years back the church bought him a very nice vehicle he then “sold” his old beater to a fairly needy family in the church. I could have fallen over when I heard it.

    Hello all enquiring minds.
    An interesting read.
    I am the son and grandson of pastors.
    My Grandfather never asked for a salary, pastored a small church of around 60 people, and insisted that any offerings beyond basic building upkeep went to supporting foreign missions. He of course worked full time to support his family (and contribute his tithe)
    My Father was salaried at various percentages of full time – for the final few years full time, and I saw the benefits that a full time focus to the ministry could bring (including the clothes that I wore and food that I ate).
    I’ve been part of the (unpaid) “eldership” of several churches, and I’ve been a part of the salary setting process. This has never been a particularly easy process, and although we’ve been generous (to the best of our ability, including exercising faith to see God fill the gap), I’ve never personally felt comfortable when salary occupies a significant proportion of church income, as little is left over to bless the community, and much focus is given towards raising money (as a consequence of the salary burden)
    Right now – and for the last few years I have been an unpaid “pastor” – of a church of around 80 people. I don’t really consider myself a pastor, but I co-ordinate, lead, and have financial oversight of a group of believers, and seek to discern God’s will for my life – and as other sheep walk that path with me, I share with them what God is doing in my heart – and they share there hearts as well.
    I also work full time in a challenging, and financially rewarding engineering management role – and God has blessed that work over the past 3 years.
    I don’t consider the two roles particularly separate. I do take care to not let my church role impact my ability to deliver value for money to my employer.
    I do very much enjoy the freedom that comes with being unpaid.
    No-one asks me to justify what I’m doing, what vacation I’m taking, or what I or my family spend our money on. (yes as a PK I know that people ask these questions!)
    I value the lack of need to compete for church members.
    We don’t mind if people walk with us, and we bless them when they choose to fellowship with others.
    It’s easier to value the poor members if we are not mentally assessing their tithing capacity (I know I’ve done this in the past! – forgive me Father).
    There is much less stress involved for me personally (spiritually) as my sense of self-worth is not wrapped up in my ability to “manage” and grow a group of believers. If the sheep find better pastures elsewhere then maybe I’ve done the job that the great shepherd has called me to. I can then enter into his rest as well!
    I not sure why I’ve typed all this, other than to re-iterate that I’ve seen all sides of the “coin”. Godliness with contentment is great gain. There is no one right way to finance church leadership. Just remember that the church belongs to Jesus (he said that he will build it) and that he is the great shepherd which we serve. We MUST not lord over the sheep – but serve them diligently, humbly and as brothers and sisters in the faith.
    I pray that each of you will receive your reward, and prosper in the will of Christ, and that wherever you are, the Kingdom of God advances.

        Hi Courntey,
        thanks for the reply… it does sound like a challenge to be in your position (understatement). I’ve prayed that our Father will continue to bless and provide for you – and that you and your family experience his love and fulfilment.

        So, because the pastor is called to a church, the wife should then neglect her own children and familiy and enter the workplace? Meanwhile having to put her children in a public school where they are introduced to all types of materialism, not to mention pay for all those clothes and shoes and bag lunches and projects? I am so irritated with this reply. How dare you assume that a pastor should not get paid and force the wife to work, neglecting now their own family, which was his first calling? To demean the office of wife and mother by saying that the pastor’s job is so important that his own children should live 8 hours at a public institution and hers is so frivolous that she may go into the secular world and provide all the things her husband can’t because of the church not paying enough is truly absurd, unbiblical and as a woman I find it incredibly insulting. I hope you will rethink this response. I know this sounds harsh, and it is meant to. ‘Christian’ men need to stop ignoring the biblical mandate that God gave women of staying home and raising children. Let the reader understand: Ministry does not mean husband preaches and wife protects. Ministry does NOT mean husband serves others, wife makes the money and government instituions raise the children. IT is NOT the church’s job to make the pastor suffer for his decision to serve the Lord. I am thankful that my husband did not take this selfish view, and allows me to stay home. I would rather my children go without shoes than go without a mother.

    Wow . . . . I am speechless with some of these posts but am better informed because of them!
    
    Great article, Thom.
    
    A big thank you to all the pastors and their wives who have poured their heart out, in their respective situations, on here. Took a few hours to read through all of them but was well worth the time. It was hard to hear people of God’s Kingdom attacking fellow brothers and sisters. Everyone received prayer tonight!
    
    If there are so many people on here who consider themselves children of God then how much greater of a need is there for leading people into a deeper fellowship with our Lord and Savior? So many know the truth but few have a personal relationship with our Father!
    
    Our society and global civilization is not the same as it was in Jesus’ time. Today’s leaders need to understand a modern culture in order to reach those with an ear to hear. We need to adapt to the problems and issues of today without sacrificing the costs associated with God’s gift of mercy. God is the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow!
    
    I do not possess a professional degree in Theology or Biblical Studies but greatly appreciate their sacrifice in academic credentials. How much more knowledge does a Medical Doctor (MD) have over a Nurse with an Associate of Arts? The Nurse is undoubtedly talented and a great resource but the MD can heal so many more people who have vastly more complicated sicknesses. The Pastor with a professional degree has more education than both and is spiritually equipped to aid in all facets of life! Not all people who are sick need to see the MD but what a blessing it is to see them when you need to. Different needs must be met accordingly.
    
    All communities within Christ’s body need their flock tended to differently. Pastors, with the proper professional credentials and spiritual guidance, will do more than bless a church and its community when they are properly compensated for their knowledge. God will pour so many blessings into church members through a Pastor . . . only if, the community allows it.

        Forgive me for jumping in here. I came across this article and I was grieved by all the comments.
        
        For one, Christians who are posting on here who are lashing out in a rude manner should get a hold of themselves and read again in Scripture that what classifies us as Jesus followers is our LOVE for one another. If we act out of impulse and not out of Love, we only give ammunition to those who create and stand by their views of stereotypical believers.
        
        Believers and non-believers, I pray that my post would educate and maybe shine God’s beautiful light on your hearts that you may find and embrace our Savior.
        
        Second, pastors, like stated above, go to college to become pastors for upwards of 5 years. In a private Christian university, it becomes expensive. How can we (I’m in school for ministry) pay for that? We also desire to have families and homes. How can that be paid for? Having a full time job on top of having to lead a body of 200+ people and families not of our own sounds awful. Pastors do charity work, travel on missions and local missions, study for amazing amounts of time, run errands for many in their congregation, and have countless visitors coming in during the week for council, bible discussions, and prayer. I feel bad often when I ask my pastor to have bible discussions with me because I know he is always strapped for time with lunches and meetings. It’s a lot of work that goes sadly unnoticed by society and media. And I’m sure if it were brought up by the pastors, many would be criticized for complaining about doing something they “should do anyway” or some other false statement.
        
        Lastly, and MOST IMPORTANTLY, I want to point out that Pastors are also a member if the Church. That is JESUS’ Church. They give as well. Not just in deeds but in money. Pastors often pay for many things such as food for events, supplies for the church, church bills, and many give generously to people who need financial help. We are men called by God to give wherever needed. We’re part of the family of Jesus Christ. Being in a family consists of supporting each other in all cases. It brings tears to my eyes knowing that people out there, believers and non believers, drop the fact that EVERYTHING in our lives including the Church, the Bible, our families, and our relationship with Jesus, BEGINS. AND ENDS. WITH. LOVE. It was God’s LOVE that created us, Gods LOVE for us that compelled him to come off of his throne to die for us, it was God’s LOVE that is ingrained in every humans heart. Love is taken out of everything once money is involved. It just goes to show that many of us are easily overcome by greed, and I’m not innocent of this. Early in my walk I struggled with not wanting to give. But God’s opened my eyes to see that everything we have is a gift. And, I know it’s cliché, but it’s true that its better to give than receive.
        
        I pray that by Gods grace our selfish ways can be put behind us, so we’re able to learn how to walk, talk, give, and serve in LOVE.
        
        I love you all, and “Grace of The Lord Jesus Christ be with you”,
        
        Sincerely,
        
        Jesus’ repentant disciple

        I have read some of these comments about pastors and I have honestly been shocked at the contempt that some have for their own pastors (assuming that they are truly faithful members of a church). Have some of you forgotten that even Jesus had a treasurer and that His ministry was financed by others? For those who believe the disciples and apostles were worthy of compensation because they move from one place to another as missionaries, but that pastors are not worthy of compensation, may I ask if the young pastor Timothy, whom Paul mentored was worthy of compensation? And may I ask how much of your personal finances you contribute to missionaries each month?
        
        Why is there such a resentment toward pastors held by those who call themselves Christians? The office of overseer or pastor is a good thing according to scripture. It is included in the five-fold ministry. As a youth pastor and now as a pastor I have noticed that it is generally true that church goers who are the least faithful, are the least reliable and give the least amount of time and effort and finances toward the advancement of the gospel are generally ones who expect most from their pastors, and who seem to be the most vocal with their criticisms. I guess the part that makes me most sad about some of the comments posted by many people on this site demanding that a pastor serve without compensation is that they most likely have (or had) a pastor that prays for them and loves them despite their contempt for him.
        
        Being a pastor is the most difficult thing I have ever done. My church compensates me with a salary that is in the “average” range, and I am grateful for what I receive. Only my wife and kids really know the time I put in as pastor. I can assure you that it is not a 40 hour per week job. I work hard, but so do those I serve as pastor. I can promise you I don’t do it for the money, but it seems based on these comments that some church goers want to be served rather than to serve. To be honest I wish I had not read some of the judgmental and critical comments made by some who understand neither the call or the duties of a pastor. Their comments cast a dark and disturbing shadow on the American church.

        Don’t Worry David – the petition charges that the “pastors” are stealing from God. The Obama administration, not exhibiting any concern for God in other areas of their government, is unlikely to do so in this case.

        Wise words from someone who knows how to discern the spoken word of God.
        
        This life is quite the journey!
        
        It is not our job to conform others to God’s ways but we can aid in bringing them to the footsteps of Jesus. He is the one who penetrates their heart through actions and deeds. Those He has taught know who is truly at the helm of all. His ways are not always understood without the Holy Spirit but they are perfect.
        
        When our focus is on Jesus and keeping His commandments the rest of life falls where it needs to.

    I do not understand why pastors cannot perform services and hold down a day job. Perhaps it is that I do not hold doctrine in high esteem, but I cherry-pick one idea from Zwingli: Let every man be his own priest. I would prefer clergy with day jobs. I suppose we’d need more of them, in order to cover all the bases when schedules get in the way, but when clergy are volunteers, I trust them more to stay on track. While I do not doubt that many pastors at small churches are paid very little, there are also clergy at churches who are paid obscene amounts that cannot be explained away with references to “expenses.” (A very large church in northeastern Florida comes immediately to mind.)

    I live in a rural part of Georgia. The church is quite large for the area of about 600 at 2 separate services.. The church has grown from 200 attendance to 600 attendance in the last 7 years. There has been 3 building projects and 3 million $ in debt. The pastor requires his pay to be a % based on church members. He makes a 6 figure salary plus a benefit package plus half of his personal items paid for such as housing which he has a 600,000.00 house a 50,000.00 car, clothing, food, utility, travel, gas, plus a debit visa for anything else. He has deacons in place to take care of the body of Christ. There are 6 to 12 families per deacon depending on family size. Our pastor will not be hindered by the church body unless there is a funeral or wedding. He says if someone calls the church needing him the deacons are not doing their job. My husband is a deacon and I’m a deacons wife. The deacons and other elders in the church takes all the burden of the church off the pastor. He stays at the church or at home all week and studies the word for lessons while others take care of the body. Our pastor is taken very well care of, he has no stress at all. He also has 8 fulltime staff members to help him during the day with what ever he needs. Most in the church thinks His pay and extras is quite excessive, but this is what he asks for and we don’t want him feeling underpaid and over worked. So the church body does most of the work for him. He says if he’s there for one, he will have to be there for all, so he doesn’t really know the people, he just runs the office and does the sermon on Sunday.

        This is an issue with your church’s form of government. You don’t say what your particular affiliation is. In the American Baptist Churches, as well as several other Protestant denominations, there is a budget committee, who recommends the salary (as well as the entire budget) to the board, who then puts it before the congregation for a vote at an annual meeting. No secrets allowed. Also, all expenditures above a certain dollar amount are also subject to board and possibly congregational approval, depending on the thresholds outlined in the church constitution.

    I was raised a “PK” (Preachers Kid); my father is a minister in a Pentecostal denomination. I am now a deacon in my church and have a lot of insight on this matter. First and foremost; treat your pastors well! They make a HUGE sacrifice to minister to you. The call on their lives do not negate the stress they deal with on a daily basis; deaths, marriages, family issues, and the everyday pettiness of congregants (what do you do all day? why didn’t you visit my aunt Suzy in the hospital two states away? How come you didn’t shake my hand? etc.). Ministry is a thankless job, and one must be called to do it. NO minister does it for the money, and it is insulting that congregants bicker over paying salaries.
    
    My father served faithfully as a minister for over 40 years, and at the age of 75 still preaches on occasion. His retirement salary? An $800 social security check and a $129 retirement check from his denomination (because churches never paid him anything, and he and my mother raised three children, they never had the extra cash to pay into a retirement fund). Although my dad lives in subsidized housing for the elderly, I’ve never heard him complain, nor would he. He would do it all over again.
    
    It is true; ministers AND their Family are owned by the church. All your pastor wants is to be appreciated; love them, pay them well, and you’ll have a prosperous church!

        John,
        The Lord has opened my eyes to this very thing lately. He has caused me to be a berean and to question many things going on today in the corporate church. The thing that is bothersome is that Jesus is used in a way that is unbiblical. Jesus gave us Paul as an example of what is to be with leaders within fellowship. I truly believe according to scripture, Paul was more of a missionary that brought people together in communities for fellowship and to help people. Pastors were considered teachers and men that were to protect the people, similar to what we call Sunday school teachers. I truly don’t believe according to scripture that one man call pastor should be front and center making a career on the gospel. God calls these men hirelings and Jeremiah has nothing good to say about pastors that take from Gods people. Giving an offering and helping with ministry needs is one thing but what goes on today in the man made corporate with pastors is entirely not what God had in mind nor is their position biblical. It’s as though every thing that goes on today with the gospel of Christ is to make a buck off something or somebody, while very little goes to helping the needy and spreading the gospel how God intended.

    I have a question. In 2009 God spoke to me about giving our pastor a pastorial offering every first Sunday. When we take up the offering, we take it up in baskets. we do not count the money, we give it directly to the pastor. Should we be counting the money and putting it down in the books? or can we just give it to him as a monthly gift without counting the money. please help. Because we want to do the right thing.

    most of us dont have an idea of what we talk about, the church members are demanding, thay want to have you ready for them daily and being available. Never mention sunday. I am living in Zimbabwe, getting less than 50 dollars a month, still faithful and depending on God. Now the church is 7years old since we started. The best favour every church can do to its pastor is to ease stress from them by sufficiently looking after them.

    I have a question what is taxation in the church? Is it right for churches to hold members accountable for taxations? I know the old testament had a legalistic tithe method but in the new testament it doesn’t hold the members to those standards. My concern is not just for the pastors but also for those who do not have funds to aid nothing but tithe and offering …also I know sometimes even tithing can be challenging. I know the Pastor and the congregation is not to bully people into giving God does the convicting.

    I am a bi-vocational Youth Pastor, and I have a real hard time with putting everything I have in my secular job and giving everything I have to the ministry and raising my family the way the Lord intended for me to. The church I am currently at cannot afford to take me on full-time currently. I struggle keeping things together and I only minister to the youth primarily. I can only imagine how much more of a burden it is to do work a full-time secular job and pastor at the same time. There will be pastors who abuse their power and authority and shame on them, but don’t hurt your man of God, because someone else blew it.
    
    The best way to look at it is, You are not paying for your Pastor to preach, make hospital visits, study, manage the church, you pay him in order so he doesn’t have to work a secular job so that he can do all of those things.

    I read the above article and I totally agree that Pastors should be paid for their vocation. Reading some of the comments, it is amazing how we can use bible scriptures to justify injustice to Pastors. Wow.
    I have been to churches with both scenarios. At one church the Pastor had a full time job and he also pastored full-time. I am sure he was thoroughly exhausted all of the time and it was only the grace of God that kept him from day to day. At another church the Pastor has worked without a salary for the last 4 years and struggles monthly to meet personal needs. In a perfect world I might agree with Destiny Cambell when she says that the elders in the church should help share the responsibilities of the church equally to take the burden off the pastor, however I am quite sure that there are some duties only the pastor can do. Also, prayer and giving has been at an all time low, so even if a pastor wanted to live off of the goodness of the congregation; trust me on this one, they would be hard-pressed to survive. One final comment, most church members are busy with their own jobs, families to take on further responsibilities than the current ones they already have at church…after all..I think that’s what God designed the Pastor for. ![[./_resources/Five_Things_You_Should_Know_about_Pastors’_Salaries_-_ThomRainer.com.resources/icon_smile.gif]]

    I am really struggling with the situation going on at my church. My pastor once told under frustration that he believed that God brought him to my church to “kill the church, to watch it die”. Because he was under a lot of pressure at the time, I did not think much of it, however, these words were burned into my mind, never to be forgotten. Red flags went up, but yet I gave him the benefit of the doubt that he was just having a bad day. So I continued to have an open mind to what he wanted to do in the church. I supported him in every way I could. This was about 3 years ago. Ever since then, he has been trying to shut down ministries in a round-about way. Every time he says he wants to do something, the next hour he will deny ever saying anything about it. He talks a good talk, but he does not do the walk. He has stopped all outreach in the church, and now he wants to shut down the children’s ministry. Granted, we do not have many members. We average approximately 30 in Sunday School and maybe on a good day, we will have 45 in worship. Our numbers have been declining since he came about 5 years ago. Especially after he made that “comment” to me. I am so frustrated. We now have a church health team (of which I participate) going over the details. This weeks meeting left me with my feathers so ruffled that I did not want to come back. It only confirmed to me what his plan was for this church. He wanted to kill our church and watch it die. Our budget cannot handle his pay. Our bank account is being drained each month. Now he wants to cut all the ministries of the church just so that he can have his salary. To keep up with his salary my church needs to bring in at least $1,000 a week. We are not able to do this because we do not have enough members now to support this. He says one week he wants to find ways to bring in young families, but then he wants to shut down ministries to do that. This does not make sense to me. He is so wishy-washy. His anger and frustration has been showing more often now, especially at the last church health team meeting. Most of the members of the church want him to leave. He wants us to keep him until the fall but I do not think we can make it that long. He first offered to have his salary cut by 25%, but now he does not want to do that, instead, just shut down the ministries. I am so angry over this whole situation. I feel bad for his 3 boys. His wife has a control issues. We had an awesome praise team, but then when she agreed to play keyboard for us, she started pushing others out of the team. She wanted to become praise team leader. She placed so much pressure on the praise team leader at that time, that he stepped down. Then she started making stupid rules like if you were not part of the praise team, you could not participate in the service, and of course, her husband went right along with that. So, others started dropping off the praise team because of the talent we have in the church, and soon it became her show. She placed her 3 sons up on stage playing instruments. Now she is happier more than ever. There is no enthusiasm like there was before. Her sons show no interest in being there on stage. I am now on the praise team, and it feels like it is just a “Pastor’s family” time. There are other issues going on as well. The pastor calls himself lazy. Even though he gets paid a full time salary, his is only in the church office for 2-3 half days. He will come in at about 9:30 or 10 then leave at about 1 or 2 for lunch and not come back. He just stays at the parsonage. He does not visit people in the hospital unless someone pressures him to do so and he won’t go see the homebound. It’s almost like he wants to get paid just for sitting in the pastor’s chair. I’m sorry. I should not be complaining nor should I be talking about a pastor like this, but I don’t think a pastor should be behaving like this. I am confused and worried. I pray every day and seek God through this situation. I thought pastors are suppose to care about the church, not let it go down the drain on purpose. I feel like I could just scream every time I go to church. Is there any advice?

    I would add, that all throughout the Torah, it was clear that the inheritance of the Levites, or the “pastors”, was God himself. His FIRE and very person was the reward. No earthly inheritance was promised to them….. The New Testament examples were NEED based as far as Paul, while the other apostles were allowed to not work a “job” and also bring a believing wife along. Lets set our standards high, and not stop preaching the gospel until money gets in the way… But, if you are faithfull preaching teh gospel, the LORD will never allow finance to come between! This in fact was the Boast that Paul would rather “die” for – the boast that he did not rely on anyone for his ministry!

    There are a variety of problems with arguing that a pastor should not be paid. I’m sure most pastors would love to be able to live without a salary but for the vast majority of them this would require them to sacrifice the care of themselves and their families. If the Lord calls a family to that so be it. But, men do not have the right to place that on others.
    
    Many of these comments are also making a mistake of creating a sacred and secular divide when it comes to work. The Lord’s first command in the garden is to work. Scripture is consistent in defending the rights of the worker and the pay of the worker whether that is the farmer or the priest. Yes, being a pastor is a different job from engineering but both are work. Many on here are arguing that if a pastor really loved God and people he would work for free. In the same line we could then say that if a doctor really cared about his patients he would work for free. Being in the care industry does not require a person to not receive compensation and care for themselves.
    
    I am well aware that many ministries and churches are not in the financial position to fully support their workers. And if the Lord calls that minister to sacrifice in that way for the gospel then praise God for their faithfulness and give additional prayers for preservation. But, for a congregant to not even have the desire to care for their pastor reveals much about their heart. You want them to care for you but you don’t even have the desire to do likewise? In the states we often do a really lousy job of submitting to those in spiritual authority to us.
    
    Instead of being so worried about the bottom line… maybe Christians should start being more concerned about their brothers and sisters in Christ…. even if they are a minister.

    A lot of comments have mentioned the fact that Pastors are overworked and should delegate more responsibilities to the underutilized church members. My question to those of this school of thought is, “how many of you are willing and able to volunteer at least 3hours of your day EVERYDAY to the church?”- and not only in the evenings AFTER work, but at 1pm in the afternoon when that sister who went through that thing that time urgently needs help, or when it’s freezing outside at 10pm and you are all cuddled up with your spouse but your attention is urgently needed in the church. Can you combine a 9-5 with these demands? How do you then expect someone else to? What percentage of the congregation are matured enough to handle a lot of the stuff Pastors handle. There is so much judgement, unforgiveness and backbiting in the body of Christ that, the problems of many are only safe in the hands of very few.
    
    You’ve talked about how a few of the new Testament apostles had secular jobs, but do you not see the difference between being a tent maker(probably working your own hours) and walking a 9-5 job in an office somewhere where you might be required to work even longer hours? Or because (s)he is a pastor means (s)he should take secular jobs with more flexible hours? Ignoring the fact that these jobs are often characterized by their instability meaning s(he) could very well be out of a job in the blink of an eye.
    
    I am neither a Pastor, nor am I even closely related to one. But as an active volunteer in church, i see the work my Pastor puts in, especially with a congregation as large as ours- over 20,000 people. He delegates a lot of stuff, but as volunteers increase, so does the size of the church. I volunteer as much as i can, but because i work a regular 9-5, and don’t get home till late due to the horrible traffic situation (something that more than half of the congregation experiences), i am not ABLE to do all I’d like to do. Even if the other half of the congregation wanted to volunteer to cover the shortfall, when do we take into consideration the fact that they may not have the right skills or calling to do so?
    
    Taking a closer look at the scriptures some have used to back up their points……..
    
    Matt 10:8 (AMP) “Cure the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, drive out demons. Freely (without pay) you have received, freely (without charge) give.”
    
    This does not mean a Pastor should not be adequately compensated by the body of Christ, but that (s)he should not charge to allow the power of God flow through him e.g. refusing to cast out a demon unless a certain fee is paid.
    
    What’s more interesting is that no one reads the verses after…… Matt 10:9 (AMP) “Take no gold nor silver nor \[even\] copper money in your purses (belts);And do not take a provision bag ora wallet for a collection bag for your journey, nor two undergarments, nor sandals, nor a staff; for the workman deserves his support (his living, his food).” The support talked about here is FROM THE CHURCH! From YOU! So if you are not willing to let Pastors be paid fairly, then you should be willing to house them, cloth them and provide 3 square meals for them and their families. LUKE 10:7 (MSG) Stay at one home, taking your meals there, for a worker deserves three square meals. Don’t move from house to house, looking for the best cook in town.”
    
    1 Tim 5:17-18 (AMP) “Let the elders who perform the duties of their office well be considered doubly worthy of honor \[and of adequate financial support\], especially those who labor faithfully in preaching and teaching. For the Scripture says, You shall not muzzle an ox when it is treading out the grain, and again, The laborer is worthy of his hire “
    
    And in the Message translation – ”Give a bonus to leaders who do a good job, especially the ones who work hard at preaching and teaching. Scripture tells us, “Don’t muzzle a working ox” and “A worker deserves his pay.”
    
    Malachi 3:10a (AMP) “Bring all the tithes (the whole tenth of your income) into the storehouse, that there may be food in My house, “
    
    Numbers 18:21 “I give to the Levites all the tithes in Israel as their inheritance in return for the work they do while serving at the tent of meeting. “
    
    The barest minimum a Pastor should receive is the tithe YOU pay. If God leads you to give extra, then so be it. But the bible clearly states that the tithe YOU pay is to feed the Pastors for the work they are doing in the house of God.
    
    God bless

    As I started to read through these comments, it has blown me away. The lack of respect many of you have for for your pastors and other ministers in your church. My pastor is one of the hardest working men I know and what he does is very much needed and appreciated. His role is just as hard work as any CEO, Farmer, etc.
    
    The one thing that I want to communicate is this; “The greatest commandment is this, love the Lord with all your heart and the second is like the first; love your neighbor”. It seems that everyone in the church always wants to criticise their church staff, but if you love them, you would pray for them daily. My pastor is compensated well, because that is our responsibility to do this, but for all he does he is underpaid. I give because I love to give my very first fruits to God and my church; It all belongs to Him and I am called to be obdient to His Word. So, if we love the Lord with all our heart, we will strive for complete obedience and be involed (SERVE) in the ministry God calls you to do. LET’S BUILD HIS KINGDOM!!!
    
    Make it a great day!

    I hardly leave comments, however I read a few of the responses here Five Things You Should Know about Pastors’ Salaries
    – ThomRainer.com. I actually do have 2 questions for you if you don’t mind.
    Is it just me or does it look as if like some of these comments come across like they
    are written by brain dead individuals? ![[./_resources/Five_Things_You_Should_Know_about_Pastors’_Salaries_-_ThomRainer.com.resources/icon_razz.gif]] And, if you are posting at other online social

    It’s been interesting reading the blogs with so many opinions on how much a pastor should be paid and if he/she should get another job to support themselves. My wife and I have been pastors for 40 years. We are still serving suffering humanity to the best of our ability with God’s help. Not only have we planned weekly worship meetings, conducted Bible studies, conducted youth meetings, senior meetings on a weekly basis, but also served people in need on a daily basis. including battered and abused wives and children, served the hungry, provided groceries to those living in poverty, helped raise the money to pay for these services, responded to disasters both natural and manmade, feeding, counseling, comforting the bereaved. Many times the calls for help would come at inconvenient times but true servants of Christ respond even when it is inconvenient. It’s what we are called to do, it’s part of our journey as pastors and ministers. There is no way either of us could have considered taking on another job. This one has taken all of our strength and focus. And if I had the chance to do it all again I would. We are not rich by any stretch of the imagination but have been able to provide for our children.
    Now both of our children are in Christian ministry along with their spouses. Our son and his wife are ministers, our daughter is a Christian marriage and family counselor and her husband is a professional Christian musician. We have five wonderful grandchildren who are being raised to love God and serve others.
    So those of you who have never served as pastors, you really don’t have a clue what we are called upon to do 24/7.
    Mega churches only represent about 1% of all the churches in America and those churches with more than 100 in attendance only make up about 10% of churches in America. Most churches avearage between 40 to 99 people. The staff available to help with church ministry is usually based on what the churh can afford to pay. The volunteer church members only make up about 20% of most congregations. So 20% of the people are doing 80% of the work while the 80% make excuses for not contributing time, money or talents to ministry. The 20% of the congregants who are closest to the pastors to see what they do on a daily basis would never be writing letters saying their pastors should work other jobs nor would they ever think that they are being overpaid for thier work.
    Serving Christ is still my heart’s desire. I must daily seek the Lord of the work before I attempt to do the work of the Lord. He is our sufficiency, our strength and joy. The Westminster catechism reminds us that the chief aim of man is to Love God and enjoy Him forever. When was the last time you enjoyed God and spent the day hanging out with Him! He is my joy giver, my provider, my all in all. Praise be to His Holy Name!

    Dr. Rainer,
    
    I have a question: I am from a modest church (about 75 – 100 people). I simply LOVE our pastor. He is a good man with a good heart. He was our friend BEFORE he was a minister; the groomsman at our wedding (his wife my matron-of-honor) over 26 years ago. He is a master plumber/heater and makes good money at it. He has a lovely home (paid for), and every member of their household drives a decent vehicle – absolutely don’t begrudge any of that. He is a very hard worker and goes above and beyond the duties of your typical “pastor.” I am truly blessed to have him not only as my friend but as my pastor as well.
    
    Here is the issue I struggle with: Our Finance Committee wants to upgrade his pay to about 1/3 to what he is probably earning at his primary job, in hopes that by continually increasing it he will quit his other job. The pastor has talked about that desire (for years) but I don’t think it will ever happen because (I feel) he fears not being financially “stable” solely as a pastor. He has worked 30+ years as a master plumbler/heater and I think that income supports the lifesyle he is comfortable with. Not only does he receive an generous income as a master plumber/heater, he also receives a modest income from the church among other perks (bonuses and $ as gifts from the congregation) and he has been doing this for about 25 years – with the hopes of “one day stepping down from his primary job.”
    
    My concern is this:
    1\. That his continued increase in pay is going to affect his ability to relate to the average person in his congregation. Already he has asked us to join his family for lunch after services but we can no longer afford the expensive resturants that his taste has grown accustomed to so we have to decline. Sometimes he will put his distaste for a lower cost resturant aside and join us but for the most part he will join others with more affulent means to a more expensive place to eat. Please do not take this as jealousy because that is not where this is coming from. I truly am concern for this man of God to be able to relate to the average people in his congregation.
    2\. What I thought was extremly ironic, was these same men who were pushing to increase wages of the pastor, completely over looked, stepped over, the maintenace salary which has remained the ridiculous amount since the conception of the church (30+ years ago) – never having an increase! And this man lives on a very modest income. Like the pastor, he has never made a request for his income to be increased.
    3\. I teach Sunday school (and have been for 20 years) and never thought to even ask to be paid (nor do I want to be). I study for hours every week and I also follow-up with my students during the week with a visit, a phone call or mailing them the lesson they missed. I am also a committee of one that does certain mission out-reaches. I, too, have a primary job outside of our church as a church secretary in a different denomination, part-time earning about $9,000 a year. Granted, I do not have all the responsibility as the pastor but it seems, to me, odd – even makes me feel uncomfortable when we keep increasing the dollar amount of someone who is already being paid handsomely while overlooking those who get paid just a “token” for the work they do. These are business men (Finance Committee) and sometimes I feel that their heart misses the spiritual aspect of the church body as we should all work together to edify the body of Christ.
    4\. My concern is that if we continue paying our pastor the way we are, he will continue to increase his lifestyle and will be unable to live within the means of what the church can pay him, even if we could match what he is getting paid from his primary job, it would still be a step-down because he would not have the “extra” from the church. Do you follow what I am trying to say?
    
    Please, can you impart some words of wisdom that will give me peace about this? Regrettably, I have even entertained the thought of leaving the church because I just feel so uncomfortable about the whole thing. If our pastor, our friend, was solely dependent on the church, I would say “Give him everything he needs to live comfortably.” If he needed anything I would say to him “All I have is yours – what do you need?” I love him that much. But I think it has gone beyond need to………greed and that is what is making me feel uncomfortable. Not greed on his part for asking for more money (because he doesn’t ask) but greed because he accepts it. And I am also concern about these men over-looking the common man. It is as if they think that increasing the pastor’s salary will secure them a place in heaven – I know that is ridiculous to say that but the thought is there none-the-less.

        No, it’s not excessive. Try pastoring for a few years and you’d quit for 90K. Most people have NO IDEA of the additional expenses that pastor’s face, until they live in a pastor’s home. If you can’t afford to buy a graduation gift, baby shower gift, birthday gift, funeral wreath, etc… No big deal, right? Let the pastor neglect to do it… 50 shades of hell are unleashed. Just one example of an additional expense.

        Erratum: There is no demonstration or reverence to show to make people understand that pastors should be pay, it is obvious that they deserve a compensation for the work they do.

    Our pastor rarely takes a paycheck and we have a mid-size crowd (200) but only 2-3 families give regularly and an actual 10%, need prayers.

    i have served in a small church for about 8-9 years and there is one bit of advice i can give you who serve. i have found that the biggest trouble makers and complainers in any issue but specifically issues pertaining to money are the ones who give very little in respect to their income or nothing at all. their issue is that they have a huge log in their eye (they do not have their own finances in order) another thing is that you can almost always tell when a person has issues they will start giving less or stop giving completely. if you notice this beware !

    If a pastor gets money for his work in the church then also the volunteers should get wages. This may cause that suddenly everyone wants to help at church.

    My mind is blown by the amount of complete ignorance being demonstrated by some of the comments. Anyone who doesn’t think pastors should be paid or paid well can go get their Mdiv (which is required by most mainline churches and even some free churches) which if you take your vocation seriously you will go to a respectable and well known seminary after your undergrad and you will end up close to 100K or more in debt for just going into ministry. Then do your job for free while working another job (in field you don’t have a degree for).If you don’t think you need extensive training or education to be a good pastor then you are in severe denial. SMH.

    As a bi-vocational (Southern Baptist) pastor for over 6 years now, I can tell a new pastor many lessons learned. I work full time, take care of a sick wife (getting better), tend to our kids and help out around the house as much as possible. Struggle everyday with stress related to financial difficulty. One, there is no such thing as a “part-time” pastor. There will be members who will understand that you also have to feed your family. There will be those who think you should be at their beckon call. Two, your members will have to know every faucet of your daily business and life. However, they will never devulge anything to you. I actually had a member interogate my 10 year old to get information about where I had been that week. No where bad, I simply chose not to say to see what the reaction would be. Three, you will never, and I mean never, make everyone happy. Four, you will be questioned about your work for the church. Keep a visitation log always noting date, who, and what was discussed. When you do Bible Studies, provide the congregation with notes. Ensure you know what Sundays and Wednesdays are scheduled to be “no service.” If they do not have a church calendar, make it a point to get one. Understand the number of sick and vacation days the church provides. Remember, pastors get sick also. Five, you will always be reproofed by your members. They will have no problem pointing our your faults. Be prepared to have some difficulty. Many believe that pastors should be super human and never sin. It hurts to say that the church today does not represent that which, I believe, Christ wanted. Always remeber this, When a church begins to only see you as an employee and not their pastor and spiritual leader, it is time to ask God where to go next.

    Thanks for the education, DeWayne. I am currently a freshman seeking a bachelors degree in ministry and regularly worry about my projected ability to support my family as a pastor, and repay my student loans. I am more than willing to maintain secular employment if it is necessary, but it is certainly not my goal to require said employment forever. I do not expect to be rich by any means, but I would expect to be compensated fairly for my level of education in the field. There are only so many hours in a day, so it is only common sense that a pastor who is required to maintain secular employment just to survive cannot be fully commited to God and His ministry.
    
    With that being said, some of the comments here are absolutely disgusting and border upon insanity. Most pastors today, even if they delegate well, bear far more responsibility than the disciples of Jesus’ time. The disciples did not have homes, electric bills or other living expenses. The early congregations did not have buildings with bills, equipment, and other responsibilities, yet those congregations supplied the disciples with housing and food at the very least. This is not the society that we live in today, and the calling of ministry has been fundamentally transformed into a real, definable full-time (and then some) career since the time of Jesus.
    
    I write this with love in my heart, but I am compelled to rebuke those here who believe that a pastor (or anyone else who serves a congregation in a near full time capacity) in today’s society should not be compensated fairly for his time. If you believe that, you are wrong.

    I feel for you. It is too bad people are people. I would guess only a small percentage of the people cause 99% of the grief. It is that way in business. I always got rid of the customers that cause 99% of the grief.
    Unfortunately you cant do that as a Pastor.

    Scott, do you realize that most ministers outside of developed countries tend to not be paid well, by their standards, if at all? What makes the call to the ministry in the US so much more demanding and expensive?
    
    Also, every christian is called to a ministry in some form or another but most work regular schedules. Maybe if the church members took on more responsibility they could help alleviate some of the burden of the pastor.
    
    I am not saying that pastors should not get compensated fairly for their time and effort. I am simply stating that the entitlement that so many feel is not supported by The Bible.

    My husband is a pastor. I work outside of the home and am the primary breadwinner because he makes so little. We tithe 10% to the church and above that for other ministries within and outside of the church, because the NT commands to give all we have. We live in a very small house by US standards. We have one child and it is hard to find room for my medical equipment and the few developmental toys we have for our daughter. We don’t have the toys that most congregation members have, like blue ray, new cars, expensive smart phones, ipads, stereo systems, ipods, cable, internet, etc. We can’t afford them. My husband’s car is on it’s last legs and we can’t afford a decent used car. Mine is nine years old but thankfully paid off and still runs well. The church is in the process of making my husband full-time, but with the cost of insurance, I’ll still have to work unless he can manage the hours of a secular job, as well. He already works far more hours than is expected for a part-time minister. Why? Because, unlike all of these posts that talk about how the body of Christ is supposed to do the work and the minister is taking on too much and not delegating (and blaming him or her for it!), the body of Christ is not doing the work, and no matter how many times our pastors try to delegate, most people are too busy. I have a very painful disease and we can’t afford for me to quit my job to seek disability.
    
    You want pastors to live in the church building? Are you going to pay for them (lead and associate) to fix it up so that it is livable? Or maybe you’d like to do what the biblical Christians did and give up everything you have and donate all of it to the church so that everybody can share? Oh wait. Pastors should do that, but not you? When Jesus went from town to town, did he stop and construct something and sell it so he had money to stay at the inns along the way? Or did Christians take him in and house him and the apostles? So are you willing to take in your pastor, feed and clothe him?
    
    A pastor should pay for a car with his own money from a secular job, you say? And buy a house (such a luxury item) with his own money from a secular job? How do you expect him to drive to visit people? Should they all just come to him? And how should those shut-ins get to him? Are you going to volunteer to bring them or to pick him up and drive him to his visitations? To the hospitals and nursing homes? How about at 3 a.m. when he gets that call? Or at 10 a.m. when you are sick at home with a cold and the pastor gets a call that a church member has passed? Are you going to leave your job to take him to see the grieving family? Or if he has a secular job, is it acceptable for him to up and leave? It’s nice to say that all members of the Christian body should pitch in and do their share, but they don’t, and furthermore, the church today is not constructed the way it was back then.
    
    So until you are willing to sell your house and your land and donate it to the church and share everything you have with the church on top of working a job outside of the church and donating a good portion of your time to the church, then maybe it is time to support your pastors who often ARE bi-vocational, working 50-80 hours in the church and then working another job on top of that where they end up neglecting their families.
    
    Be the change you want to see. Until you are willing to live the destitute life you expect of your pastor, don’t expect it of your pastor (being that the body of Christ are all supposed to be sacrificial, giving of all they have to support one another).

    \[…\] 5 Things You Should Know About Pastors Salaries by Thom RainerIn many churches, the pastor’s salary is a quiet issue. There is a sense of discomfort from both the pastor and the members when the topic is broached. Such discomfort is unfortunate, however, because a number of churches will not seek every year to make certain the pastor is paid.  Read More.  \[…\]
