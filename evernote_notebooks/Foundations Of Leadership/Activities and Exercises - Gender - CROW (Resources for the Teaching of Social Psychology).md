2\. Another idea I have for you involves gathering up a bunch of magazines (Maxim and Cosmopolitan/Glamour/Elle work well). I randomly passed them out to my class as they entered the room. At the beginning of class I told them to pretend that they were coming to this planet for the first time (I know that sounds a bit weird). I asked them to use the magazine they were holding as a good "reference" for learning what men and women were supposed to act/be like in our culture. I had them jot down some notes, and then we had a really neat discussion afterward about the media's portrayal of gender. It was a nice set-up for a number of things (gender roles, body image, careers, personality, etc.).
