# Leadership Styles based on Myers Briggs/Jungian theory

There are eight leadership styles in the MMDI™ system (which is based on the theories of Isabel Briggs Myers and C.G. Jung). To be an effective and fulfilled leader requires finding an appropriate balance between:

*   **Your preferences**\- your leadership profile is a unique mix of preferences for the eight styles. Some people prefer to use a few styles, others like to use a balance of all the styles.
*   **Contextual demand** - what makes a good leader depends on the context and culture.

There are links to descriptions of each of the styles in the table, right. You can also learn about your own leadership style by completing the [MMDI personality and leadership test](http://www.teamtechnology.co.uk/personality/test/mmdi/). It gives you a free online report of your personality type and preferred leadership style, and an optional 42-page Leadership Report that provides more in-depth analysis.
