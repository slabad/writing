> >               Judah's True Hope: The Messianic King (7-12)**
> > 
> > **OBJECTIVES IN STUDYING THIS SECTION**
> > 
> > 1) To note the prophecies of Isaiah during reign of Ahaz, king of Judah,
> >    those related to the Assyrian invasion and those that looked to the
> >    coming of the Messiah
> > 
> > 2) To glean principles related to God's use of the nations in exercising
> >    His judgment
> > 
> > 3) To consider "prophetic suggestion" as a concept to understanding
> >    Biblical prophecy
> > 
> > **SUMMARY**
> > 
> > Chapters seven through twelve complete the first major section of the
> > book of Isaiah (**Prophecies Concerning Judah And Jerusalem, chs. 1-12**).
> > They contain historical narrative and prophecies delivered during the
> > time of Ahaz, king of Judah (ca. 735-732 B.C.).  Jerusalem was being
> > threatened by Syria and Israel for refusing to join them in their
> > resistance against Assyria.  Ahaz and Judah were tempted to seek help
> > from Assyria in the north and Egypt in the south.  Isaiah and his sons
> > were used by God to encourage Ahaz and his nation to trust in the Lord,
> > not political alliances.  Isaiah's prophetic utterances not only looked
> > to the more immediate deliverance from God, but also to the time in
> > which God would provide ultimate deliverance for Judah.  This section
> > can therefore be entitled, **"Judah's True Hope: The Messianic King
> > (7-12)"** (as outlined by **Edward J. Young**).
> > 
> > Chapter seven describes **The Syrian-Israel Crisis** in which God sent
> > Isaiah and his son to encourage Ahaz and offer a sign from the Lord.
> > Though rebuffed by Ahaz, the Lord provides a sign related to a son to be
> > born of a virgin whose name would be Immanuel ("God with us").  Some
> > commentators opine that this prophecy had an initial fulfillment during
> > the time of Ahaz, but was intended by God to offer hope for a time yet
> > in the future:  "...nothing is more common in Isaiah than for him to
> > commence a prophecy with reference to some remarkable deliverance which
> > was soon to occur, and to terminate it by a statement of events
> > connected with a higher deliverance under the Messiah. By the laws of
> > 'prophetic suggestion,' the mind of the prophet seized upon resemblances
> > and analogies; was carried on to future times, which were suggested by
> > something that he was saying or contemplating as about to occur, until
> > the mind was absorbed, and the primary object forgotten in the
> > contemplation of the more remote and glorious event." (**Barnes**).  That
> > this sign finds its ultimate fulfillment in the birth of the Messiah is
> > evident from Matthew's inspired application of it in his gospel (**[Mt 1:18-23](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%201.18-23)**).  While the sign was intended to show that Judah would be safe
> > from the threatened invasion by Syria and Israel, Isaiah does foresee
> > that Judah will later suffer desolation from Assyria and Egypt, the very
> > nations from which Ahaz was seeking help (**7:1-25**)!
> > 
> > Beginning with another sign (though some relate it to the same sign in
> > **7:14**) involving a son of Isaiah, we find prophecies pertaining to **The
> > Assyrian Invader**.  Syria and Israel will fall at the hands of the kings
> > of Assyria, who will then pass through Judah seeking to destroy it as
> > well.  Judah is encouraged to place their trust in God and His Word with
> > the assurance that better days are ahead.  This sparks another glimpse
> > into the time of the Messiah, when His coming and government will usher
> > in peace and justice.  In the meantime, Assyria's schemes are restricted
> > by God, who will allow the invader to do only what fits the Divine
> > Purpose in disciplining Judah and preserving a remnant of Israel.  Once
> > that purpose is accomplished, God will judge Assyria for its own
> > arrogance (**8:1-10:34**).
> > 
> > The prophecies concerning the invasion by Assyria and its aborted end
> > are followed by prophecies related to **Judah's Hope In The Messiah**.  From
> > the branch of Jesse (the father of David) will come One who will reign
> > in righteousness and peace, in Whom even the Gentiles will seek.  The
> > Lord will recover a remnant of Israel "a second time" to participate in
> > His reign.  They will be moved to offer hymns of praise for God's
> > wonderful salvation, inviting others to join with them (**11:1-12:6**).
> > 
> > As suggested before, the Messianic prophecies may be looking to the time
> > of the Messiah as a whole (prophetic foreshortening), in which the
> > **inauguration** of the Lord's kingdom and its **culmination** are described as
> > one picture seen from a great distance.  The actual fulfillment, its
> > **timing** (what relates to the first coming of Christ, what relates to His
> > second coming) and **nature** (is it literal or figurative), can be fully
> > understood only as it comes to pass and with the help of inspired
> > interpretations provided by the Lord and His apostles (e.g., **[Lk 24:44-47](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Lk%2024.44-47); [2Pe 3:13-14](http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/2Pe%203.13-14)**).
