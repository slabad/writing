> *   The **objectives** are usually things I plan to emphasize during the class.

> *   I have found that **summarizing** and **outlining** helps me to better understand the Word of God. It is a practice I highly recommend to others.
>     
> *   I generally delete the answers to the **review questions** before printing the material and giving it to the students. But that you might know what answers were intended by the questions, I have included them in these guides.

> I hope that you find the material beneficial. Some have used it for personal devotions, and others in their church or home study groups. In whatever way it can be used to the glory of God, I am grateful.
