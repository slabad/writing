# Israelite Dynasties

by [Wayne Blank](http://www.keyway.ca/htm2002/roadsign.htm)

A _dynasty_ can be defined as "a sequence of powerful leaders in the same family." The dynasty of [King David](http://www.keyway.ca/htm2002/david.htm) and his son [King Solomon](http://www.keyway.ca/htm2002/solomon.htm) ruled the united kingdom of Israelites until they split into two kingdoms, Israel and Judah, at the time of [King Rehoboam](http://www.keyway.ca/htm2000/20000507.htm). After the division, the dynasty of David continued unbroken in Judah, while there were nine dynasties in Israel.

The northern kingdom of Israel lasted just over 200 years before they were conquered and taken away into exile by the Assyrians. They never returned, and have become known to history as the "Lost Ten Tribes of Israel." See [Ancient Empires - Assyria](http://www.keyway.ca/htm2002/ancassy.htm) and [Jews At War With Israel](http://www.keyway.ca/htm2002/jewatwar.htm).

The northern kingdom of Israel had 9 dynasties, with a total of 19 kings:
1\. Jeroboam, Nadab
2\. Baasha, Elah
3\. Zimri
4\. Omri, Ahab, Ahaziah, Jehoram
5\. Jehu, Jehoahaz, Joash, Jeroboam II, Zechariah
6\. Shallum
7\. Menahem, Pekahiah
8\. Pekah
9\. Hoshea

**One Dynasty In Judah**

The southern kingdom of Judah lasted slightly over 300 years before they were conquered and taken into exile by the [Babylonians](http://www.keyway.ca/htm2002/whybab.htm) under [King Nebuchadnezzar](http://www.keyway.ca/htm2002/nebuch.htm). Unlike the northern kingdom however, a remnant of the southern kingdom was allowed to return and resettle Jerusalem in the time of [Ezra](http://www.keyway.ca/htm2002/ezra.htm) and [Nehemiah](http://www.keyway.ca/htm2002/nehemiah.htm) after the Babylonians were themselves conquered by the Persians under Cyrus the Great. Their descendants are known as the Jews of today.

The southern kingdom of Judah had only one dynasty, that of David, with a total of 19 kings and the temporary usurper Athaliah from the northern kingdom.
