[[Russell Moore - Capitol Attack Article]]

```ad-quote
This kind of emergency, we’re told, can’t worry about constitutional norms or about Christian character. The reasoning goes that the Sermon on the Mount isn’t a suicide pact and the way of Jesus only works with enemies more reasonable than these, like, I suppose, the Roman empire that crucified the one who gave us such teaching.

Such is the sign not of a post-Christian culture but of a post-Christian Christianity, not of a secularizing society but of a paganizing church.

This is profound and deserves more thought.

From a facebook comment on [[Kristen KobesDumez]] post about the above article:
```ad-quote
the problem isn’t paganism, it’s Constantinianism, which has dominated Christianity for most of its history. Tree worshipers didn’t corrupt the message of Jesus; marrying up Paul’s evangelistic efforts aimed at freeing his fellow Jews from legalistic religious practices with the structure and authority of the Roman Empire did.
```

I'm not sure I agree with this. I do like the concept of [[Constantinianism]], however, I think we need to be careful about glorifying paganism as well. It is easy to start going down a path of normalizing things which also leads to [[syncretism]] which is the real issue.
