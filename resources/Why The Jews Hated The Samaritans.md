# Why The Jews Hated The Samaritans - TruthBook

> ## Excerpt
> 

---
   143:4.2 The religious enmity between the Jews and the Samaritans dated from the return of the former from the [Babylonian captivity,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_captivity) when the Samaritans worked to prevent the rebuilding of [Jerusalem.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem) Later they offended the Jews by extending friendly assistance to the armies of Alexander. In return for their [friendship](https://truthbook.com/urantia-book/topical-studies/friendship) Alexander gave the Samaritans permission to build a temple on [Mount Gerizim,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Gerizim) where they worshiped [Yahweh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahweh) and their tribal gods and offered sacrifices much after the order of the temple services at Jerusalem. At least they continued this worship up to the time of the Maccabees, when John Hyrcanus destroyed their temple on Mount Gerizim. The Apostle [Philip](https://truthbook.com/philip-the-curious) in his labors for the Samaritans after the death of Jesus, held many meetings on the site of this old Samaritan temple.

   143:4.3 The antagonisms between the Jews and the Samaritans were time-honored and historic; increasingly since the days of Alexander they had had no dealings with each other. The twelve [apostles](https://truthbook.com/jesus/apostles) were not averse to preaching in the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks) and other gentile cities of the [Decapolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decapolis) and [Syria,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria) but it was a severe test of their [loyalty](https://truthbook.com/urantia-book/topical-studies/loyalty) to the Master when he said, "Let us go into Samaria." But in the year and more they had been with Jesus, they had developed a form of personal loyalty which transcended even their faith in his teachings and their prejudices against the Samaritans.
