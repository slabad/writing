Two things - 
- How we think: Value
	- You know how valuable something is by what someone is willing to pay
		- What is our value, what is our neighbor's value
		- This is the thing that can change our perspective
		- 1 Peter 1:18
			- You were not redeemed with silver and gold
			- We were bought back with the blood of Christ
				- This is our worth to God
			- This tells us our value
		- Not only true of us but also of our neighbor
			- God tells us how much our neighbor is worth
		- We have immense value
			- How do we treat something of immense value?

					- Centuries of national conflict, religious and racial tension

					- discomfort, messiness, inconveniences, differences
					- Barriers that have been built and bolstered by the media
		- Price to pay
			- time, money
			- we are called to pay the price for our neighbor's healing
