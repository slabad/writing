# Mark 12 NIV - The Parable of the Tenants - Jesus then - Bible Gateway

> ## Excerpt
> The Parable of the Tenants - Jesus then began to speak to them in parables: “A man planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a pit for the winepress and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place. At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard. But they seized him, beat him and sent him away empty-handed. Then he sent another servant to them; they struck this man on the head and treated him shamefully. He sent still another, and that one they killed. He sent many others; some of them they beat, others they killed.

28 One of the teachers of the law([T](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+12&version=NIV#cen-NIV-24702T "See cross-reference T")) came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, “Of all the commandments, which is the most important?”

29 “The most important one,” answered Jesus, “is this: ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.\[[e](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+12&version=NIV#fen-NIV-24703e "See footnote e")\] 30 Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’\[[f](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+12&version=NIV#fen-NIV-24704f "See footnote f")\]([U](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+12&version=NIV#cen-NIV-24704U "See cross-reference U")) 31 The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’\[[g](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+12&version=NIV#fen-NIV-24705g "See footnote g")\]([V](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+12&version=NIV#cen-NIV-24705V "See cross-reference V")) There is no commandment greater than these.”

32 “Well said, teacher,” the man replied. “You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him.([W](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+12&version=NIV#cen-NIV-24706W "See cross-reference W")) 33 To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.”([X](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+12&version=NIV#cen-NIV-24707X "See cross-reference X"))

34 When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.”([Y](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+12&version=NIV#cen-NIV-24708Y "See cross-reference Y")) And from then on no one dared ask him any more questions.
