1.  Samaritans:
	1. Descendants of the population exchange carried out by the Assyrians in 722 BCE.  Most of the northern kingdom was deported and dispersed among other conquered kingdoms and some from those other kingdoms were brought in to live in the north.  Intermarriage occured. [http://www.bible-history.com/Samaritans/SAMARITANSWho_Were_They.htm](http://www.bible-history.com/Samaritans/SAMARITANSWho_Were_They.htm) 
	2. They viewed themselves as the truly faithful Jews and perceived those living in the south (the Jews) as the Heretics
		1. Think Catholic/Protestant or Sunni/Shiite
			1. Kind of a liberal version of the Jews in Judea and Galilee.
		2. Many similarities, but they themselves viewed each other as radically different...to the point where they fought and killed each other
			1. 150 years prior, the Jews had marched up and destroyed the Samaritans’ temple on Mount Gerizim
	3. By the time of Christ, the Samaritans were severely despised by the Jews and to be called a "Samaritan" was to be numbered with the tax collectors and sinners. [http://www.bible-history.com/Samaritans/SAMARITANSA_Mixed_Race.htm](http://www.bible-history.com/Samaritans/SAMARITANSA_Mixed_Race.htm) 
	4. Because the Samaritans were sometimes hostile, and also the fact that a Jew believed that he could become contaminated by passing through Samaritan territory, Jews who were traveling from Judea to Galilee or vice versa would cross over the Jordan river and avoid Samaria by going through Transjordan, and cross back over the river again once they had reached their destination. 
		1. The Samaritan was publicly cursed in their synagogues.
		2. He could not serve as a witness in the Jewish courts. 
		3. He could not be converted to Judaism as a proselyte.
		4. He was excluded from the afterlife.
	5. About 700 Samaritans remain in Palestine today. [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/04/14/eveningnews/main1501069.shtml](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/04/14/eveningnews/main1501069.shtml)**
