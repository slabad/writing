The sadness and grief continue even as we are over one month in to Connor's cancer ordeal. Last night Collette contrasted Josh's engagement with Chad's current state and Clay with Connor. It can feel like our boys have all the issues while the Showalter boys get to lead a normal life and move on with theirs.

Comparisons are never helpful in these situations, and yet it is nearly impossible not to compare. It is always easy to look at those around us who seem to have it easier or fewer challenges and ask the why question.

I continue to wrestle with Chad and his future. I went to see Spiderman: No way home with him last night. I felt we left Christmas vacation on somewhat decent terms. Yet there is an underlying frustration there on my end. Is it selfishness? Is that all it is? He is frustrating my wants and goals and therefore I get frustrated? It makes me feel so mean and petty.
