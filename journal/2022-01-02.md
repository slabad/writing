The first Sunday of 2022. I feel spiritually lost. Perhaps directionless is a better word for it. I feel like I've been tumbling down this path for years. I've learned what sounds and looks good but I have not been nurturing my soul.

This comes out especially in my relationship with Chad.  I've been struggling with it for years. Yesterday, Collette and I started the conversation. She rightfully called me out on my selfishness in the situation.

For some months now, I have been dreading RBC coming to a close and trying to figure out the next steps for Chad and what that looks like. I absolutely dread the thought of having him live with us on a longterm basis. I can feel the stress building within me as I think about that. I want to figure out why. 

Collette pointed out that when Chad gets frustrated or feels slighted, he responds with little digs at people. I have felt this over and over. I mean, it makes sense. He is picking up on my frustration and is responding in kind. I would do the same.

The question I am wrestling with is why I struggle in my relationship with him so much? Why am I so critical of him? Why am I embarrased by the things he does that I don't feel are connected to his medical issues? I know that I have grace for others where I do not for him. It is wrong. I should extend grace to him. I should give him space to make mistakes.

Is it because I don't see much of a future for him? His options are limited for sure. At the same time, I also see snippets where I think that maybe I short change him and don't give him enough credit.

It is a challenge. I am determined to begin processing this and dealing with how I feel.
