Psalm 69:30-36

English Standard Version

I will praise the name of God with a song;  
 I will magnify him with thanksgiving.  
This will please the Lord more than an ox  
 or a bull with horns and hoofs.  
When the humble see it they will be glad;  
 you who seek God, let your hearts revive.  
For the Lord hears the needy  
 and does not despise his own people who are prisoners.

Let heaven and earth praise him,  
 the seas and everything that moves in them.  
For God will save Zion  
 and build up the cities of Judah,  
and people shall dwell there and possess it;  
 the offspring of his servants shall inherit it,  
 and those who love his name shall dwell in it.

### journal:

I preached yesterday about loving your neighbor. I am haunted by what I am doing about it.  If I truly believe what I taught, I need to make more effort to notice and have compassion on those around me.
