The first of Jesus’ signs was at Cana in Galilee. He revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.

```ad-note
title: John 2:1-12
collapse:
2 On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there, 2 and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding. 3 When the wine was gone, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They have no more wine.”

4 “Woman, why do you involve me?” Jesus replied. “My hour has not yet come.”

5 His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.”

6 Nearby stood six stone water jars, the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial washing, each holding from twenty to thirty gallons.

7 Jesus said to the servants, “Fill the jars with water”; so they filled them to the brim.

8 Then he told them, “Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet.”

They did so, 9 and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not realize where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside 10 and said, “Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink; but you have saved the best till now.”

11 What Jesus did here in Cana of Galilee was the first of the signs through which he revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him.

12 After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother and brothers and his disciples. There they stayed for a few days.

*Believed in him*... They put their faith in him. This supernatural act of power convinced them that Jesus was something special. They saw with their own eyes and believed.

It is interesting to put yourself in their position at that point in time without knowing the end of the story. What were their expectations? I would assume some saw this as a means to power and wealth. Someone with this kind of power could weild a great deal of power in the natural world.

Yet, it would not become an every day thing...it wasn't something that Jesus trotted out every day by any means.

He did enough to reveal himself and who he was and called us to trust him in the day to day. To know that he is with us, walking along side us.

Power corrupts. It tends to be misused by those who wield it. The problem is, that it becomes an end in itself rather than a means to an end.

The American church is heading down a dangerous path, one that Jesus himself rejected. That of seeking earthly power.

Lord, in this season of pain for our family, I plant a stake and reaffirm my belief in you. I declare that you are God. I declare that you are the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. I thank you for your presence with me in the valley.  I thank you for the reminder that the best is yet to come, not in this life but the next. 

Forgive me for being self seeking. Forgive me for seeking power and wealth in this world. 

I think you for all you have given us and am overwhelmed by the wealth in which you have entrusted to Collette and me. Give us the grace to hold it losely. Give us the grace to give freely and live generously.

Open our eyes to see you at work around us.
